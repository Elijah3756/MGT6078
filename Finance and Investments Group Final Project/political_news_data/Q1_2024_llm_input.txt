Israel's tech sector remains strong since the start of the war, according to new data from Startup Nation Central. In the nearly six months since the war began on October 7, Israeli startups have raised $3.1 billion in 220 private financing rounds. The biggest financing round completed since the start of the war was by fintech company Next Insurance, which received investments of over $250 million from each of two foreign investment funds. RELATED ARTICLES IVC-LeumiTech: Israeli startups raised $1.6b in Q1 The data also show that the overall amount of mergers and acquisitions in Israel's tech sector since the start of the war totaled $3.7 billion. Among the companies acquired for large amounts were Talon Security, acquired by Palo Alto Networks for $625 million, Dig Security, also acquired by Palo Alto for $350 million, Avalor acquired by Zscaler for $350 million and Gem Security acquired by Israeli company Wiz for $350 million. Two other cybersecurity companies - Flow Security and Spera Security, were acquired for $200 million and $130 million, respectively. In the healthcare sector, there were also major acquisitions with CartiHeal, which manufactures coral implants to support damaged human cartilage, acquired for $330 million. "After the war, I anticipate a startup baby-boom of tech companies" The report found that since October 7, 20 new Israeli venture capital funds have been founded that have raised an overall $2 billion. Eleven of the funds were founded to provide a response to the urgent needs of startups experiencing financing difficulties because of the war. Among these funds were Iron Nation, the resilience fund set up by OurCrowd, Trendlines - Startup Shield SPV, a fund supported by Google Support Fund, as well as other funds. These figures come alongside a significant fall in manpower in the industry since October 7, with about 15% of employees drafted into the army reserves and short term financing shortfalls caused by the war, mainly hitting early stage startups. The data for the report was gathered by Finder Spotlight Research. SNC CEO Avi Hasson said, "With attractive valuations and significant growth potential, the Israeli tech ecosystem is showing characteristic resilience. I anticipate seeing a new wave of innovation - a ‘startup baby boom’ of tech companies - which will create even more dynamic opportunities for our sector after this war."

World US updates export curbs on AI chips, tools to China Listen Listen Text Size Print gettyimagesbank Published Mar 30, 2024 8:24 pm KST Updated Mar 30, 2024 8:24 pm KST The Biden administration revised rules aimed at making it harder for China to access U.S. artificial intelligence (AI) chips and chipmaking tools, Friday, part of an effort to hobble Beijing's chipmaking industry over national security concerns. The rules, released in October, seek to halt shipments to China of more advanced AI chips designed by Nvidia and others as Washington cracks down on Beijing over concerns its advancing tech sector could help boost China's military. The new rules, which run 166 pages in length, go into effect next Thursday. They clarify, for example, that restrictions on chip shipments to China also apply to laptops containing those chips. The Commerce Department, which oversees export controls, has said it plans to continue updating its restrictions on technology shipments to China as it seeks to bolster and fine-tune the measures.

Getty Images/iStockphoto Listen to this podcast We speak to Priyanka Sharma, the executive director of the Cloud Native Computing Forum about having blind faith in tech innovation Podcast During the recent KubeCon/CloudNativeCon 2024 event in Paris, Computer Weekly met with Priyanka Sharma, executive director of the Cloud Native Computing Forum (CNCF), to record this podcast, looking into trends driving Kubernetes, inclusivity and the perceived gap between the cloud native community and senior IT management. The tech industry is constantly pushing new technologies. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the latest tech driving conversations across the tech sector. It is something those involved in advancing Kubernetes and cloud native architectures regard as an important technolology to support. But like many tech innovations, there is a lot of industry hype associated wuth AI. Quoting Alan Greenspan, former chief of the Federal Reserve Board in the US, Sharma used her keynote to discuss “irrational exuberance” in technology innovation. Greenspan’s quote refers to the risk that some US stock prices are overvalued. In the tech sector and across society, Sharma points out that people get very excited about new technology innovation. She says they invest in resources and spend time looking into concepts that are not 100% fully thought through. Some of these may not yield the results needed to give a return on this investment. “Identifying that something is irrationally exuberant is,” says Sharma: “When there's a bit of cognitive dissonance.” Sharma is a self-taught software developer and she admits she has had ups and downs in her journey in software development. Her journey began when she was setting up her own startup. “We had to build our website. Someone had to get it going and that's how I learned.” Now, full time at CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation), her main opportunities to drill down into software development happens in preparation for the twice-yearly KubeCon/CloudNativeCon events. Kubernetes is being positioned as the technology to make AI workable. Container orchestration is being applied to manage graphics processing units (GPUs) for running machine learning and inference workloads. During her keynote presentation, Sharma gave a little demo showcasing the ease with which she could depoy a Large Language Model (LLM) application on her laptop using Kubernetes. She says: “Over the last few years, I have actually really enjoy doing my keynotes. That's where I've made a conscious decision to immerse myself in a certain technology, learn as much as I can and develop a demo with the help of my team and then deliver it. That is often the way I get to stay engaged [in software development] while also running an organisation that has as large of a footprint as CNCF.” In the video below, Enterprise Strategy Group analysts discusss the highlights of KubeCon 2024 in Paris.

China’s high-tech sector is driving an increasing amount of demand for goods and services in the world’s second-biggest economy, and its contribution could rival real estate by 2026, according to Bloomberg Economics. “The high tech sector has potential to become a much more significant source of growth,” economists Chang Shu and Eric Zhu wrote in a report Bloomberg Terminal . It’s estimated to drive demand worth nearly 19% of GDP by 2026, up from 14.3% last year, and almost on par with the property sector now.

War in Ukraine has pushed women into more leadership roles in its growing tech sector, where they are gaining experience and contacts abroad that could help rebuild the economy when the conflict ends, some entrepreneurs, companies and investors say. With most men unable to leave Ukraine, women tech entrepreneurs like Anna Lissova, 30, who runs mental health startup Pleso Therapy, have taken charge of raising funds, finding new clients abroad and embracing other key roles. Before the war she focused on recruiting therapists in Ukraine. Now she travels abroad to pitch the company at conferences and has led product launches in Poland and Romania. “I had to suddenly change my role and take over the public representation of the company. The war led to women taking more senior positions and power in startups,” she said. Martial law prohibits most men of military age from leaving the country, creating a need and space for female tech entrepreneurs at home and abroad. They are able to build on a stronger representation by women in leadership positions in Ukraine than in the European Union and globally. Some say they still face prejudice in the traditionally male-dominated tech industry however, or describe their struggles to run a business while adapting to life as a refugee and having to raise families alone with fathers still in Ukraine. Over the past decade, Ukraine has boasted one of eastern Europe’s fastest growing tech hubs with startups attracting funding and clients from a large domestic market. Proportion Women were underrepresented however, making up only around 30 per cent of managers in the professional, scientific and technical sector, whereas they occupied 40pc of leadership positions in Ukraine overall in 2017-2022, according to a study by the United Nations Development Programme. The study highlighted that the proportion of Ukrainian women leaders nonetheless outstripped a figure of 35pc for the European Union and 29pc globally. Separate figures by Eurostat show around 17pc of major tech jobs are held by women in the European Union. Reuters spoke to nearly a dozen venture capitalists, tech founders and industry officials to document the critical – and often new – roles women have played in driving a sector seen as key to Ukraine’s economic prospects when the war ends. “Women’s leadership within the tech sector has become more pronounced after the full-scale invasion,” said Pavlo Kartashov, director of the Ukrainian Startup Fund (USF), a government-backed body that seeds startups. This rings especially true for ambitious startups looking to grow abroad, as many that have stayed in Ukraine focus on military or war-related technology such as drones, he added. The tech sector has proved resilient. While Ukraine’s GDP plummeted nearly 30pc in 2022, tech sector revenue rose nearly 1pc to $7.97 billion and was forecast to increase to $8bn in 2023, according to state statistics compiled by the Lviv Tech Cluster. The industry also accounts for nearly 5pc of Ukraine’s GDP with the number of tech specialists inside and outside Ukraine rising to 307,000 in 2023 from 285,000 in 2022. These numbers include the Lisbon-based founder of digital currency payment platform GeekPay. Veronica Korzh, who founded the startup three months after leaving Ukraine in February 2022, has witnessed a leap in female founders, due in part to increased access to investors outside Ukraine and accelerator programs targetting women funded by the EU, international bodies and tech multinationals. For many tech workers, Poland is a first stop as it borders Ukraine and the countries have long business and cultural ties. Anastasiia Smyk, 27, an aeronautical engineer, launched her aviation operations management software company Input Soft outside Ukraine in Warsaw, where she tapped a burgeoning refugee tech community. Her product is now used in the US, Latin America and Southeast Asia. “When talking to male investors, there were questions like ‘Why were you appointed CEO of this company?’ or ‘Please share if you have any male business partners’” she said. But she fought against the prejudice. “My job was to find investments, recognition in the global market, and international clients who would become our early adopters, which was not easy for a no-name startup company from Ukraine,” Smyk said. Looking at the startups founded by Ukrainian refugees she predicts many will return to the country when the war ends and give a huge boost.

Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (WV News) — As the technology sector becomes more and more prevalent nationally, West Virginia officials believe the state can capitalize on the growth and bring more companies here, although they noted that it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. For 30 years, the goal of the West Virginia High Technology Foundation — located in Fairmont — has been to bring more technology jobs to North Central West Virginia, and it has succeeded in landing federal agencies like NASA and NOAA to its doorstep and the I-79 Technology Park. West Virginia High Technology Foundation President and CEO Jim Estep said he “firmly believes” the state will suffer if the technology sector isn’t made a priority of economic development throughout the state. Estep “I know that’s a drum I’ve beaten for a long time, but it remains as true today as it did 20 years ago,” Estep said. “As I look around our region, I’d like to see more growth in our federal operations across the board. “However, at the same time, I’m very enthusiastic about what NOAA is doing here in the park. They launched basically a $300 million expansion here in the park just before Christmas, which is going to see an amazing upgrade of the infrastructure we have to support high-performance computing and the next generation of satellite ground systems.” John Deskins, director of the Bureau of Business and Economic Research in West Virginia University’s John Chambers College of Business and Economics, said he, too, sees the chance for West Virginia to capitalize on the national growth of tech. Deskins “I see opportunities because that’s a sector that’s growing nationally, and it’s a sector that will continue to be important as our economy evolves over time,” Deskins said. “There’s a pie out there to potentially grab a piece of.” He said that, generally speaking, the state shouldn’t be tightly holding onto a sector that’s shrinking nationally. But he added that while the technology sector may be a great investment for some parts of the state, it’s not the answer everywhere. “When we look for opportunities, we have to find things that we have a comparative advantage in,” Deskins said. “We have to go to a potential company and say, ‘This is why it would be in your best interest to come to West Virginia.’ In some places of West Virginia, we might have that comparative advantage that will be attractive to the tech sector. … “In North Central West Virginia, there is a lot of tech sector (growth) already. There might be a good reason why those companies can locate there. But, I doubt that applies to all counties in West Virginia.” Deskins said that if the technology sector doesn’t “fit in” with an area’s existing economy — especially regions of the state with poor broadband connections — it would be hard to convince a company to invest millions of dollars into building a facility there. “The competition is very stiff because every state is trying to attract tech jobs, so I wouldn’t want … some parts of West Virginia to focus on the tech sector to the detriment of other possibilities,”he said. “We’re not going to get companies to come here out of the kindness of their heart. It has to be in their best interest to come here.” Estep said that while his vision has received a lot of support from West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice — noting Justice’s support has been invaluable — it also hasn’t translated to the kind of support Estep believes is needed from the state as a whole. Estep said he believes in order for the state to reach its potential with the technology sector, the opportunities need to be recognized by policymakers and legislators in Charleston. “That has to be a central part of our economic development policy,” Estep said. “Secondly, significant investment needs to be made available for us to participate nationally. This takes real investment. This takes forward thinking strategy that is not just a press opportunity — a real investment in institutionalizing this type of industry in our state and economy.” While the technology is growing nationally, Deskins cautioned certain areas of the state against going after associated companies just because of the “sexy” appeal. “I wouldn’t want to get distracted by something that sounds (good) over something that’s more realistic or doable for certain parts of West Virginia,” Deskins said. “We want to be very balanced and objective. We don’t want to be overly focused on traditional energy jobs because that’s our history, but at the same time, we don’t want to throw our hands up and say ‘These jobs are going away so we need to focus on the tech sector.’ … “There has to be a balanced and objective approach to think about what will work for us over the next 20 years. It’s difficult.” Fairmont News Editor John Mark Shaver can be reached at 304-844-8485 or jshaver@theet.com . You must be logged in to react. Click any reaction to login.

Many global bodies are out to boost women's representation in tech across the board, amid research showing firms with a higher proportion of women are more profitable, spend more on research and development and are more environmentally-minded, according to a report by the World Economic Forum. "I've seen more women starting companies after the war and taking on bigger positions because they can talk to investors and help develop brands to new customers," Korzh said. "This is also helping keep attention on Ukraine and spreading the word about the potential of its tech sector." For many tech workers, Poland is a first stop as it borders Ukraine and the countries have long business and cultural ties. Mykhailo Khaletskyi of the Polish-Ukrainian Startup Bridge - a group that provides grants, co-working space and other assistance said: "We see women driving new funding rounds and gaining experience that will help to establish new companies and attract international talent and funding," he said. Anastasiia Smyk, 27, an aeronautical engineer, launched her aviation operations management software company Input Soft outside Ukraine in Warsaw, where she tapped a burgeoning refugee tech community.

Article Content:
PRAGUE (Reuters) - War in Ukraine has pushed women into more leadership roles in its growing tech sector, where they are gaining experience and contacts abroad that could help rebuild the economy when the conflict ends, some entrepreneurs, companies and investors say. With most men unable to leave Ukraine, women tech entrepreneurs like Anna Lissova, 30, who runs mental health startup Pleso Therapy, have taken charge of raising funds, finding new clients abroad and embracing other key roles. Before the war she focused on recruiting therapists in Ukraine. Now she travels abroad to pitch the company at conferences and has led product launches in Poland and Romania. "I had to suddenly change my role and take over the public representation of the company. The war led to women taking more senior positions and power in startups," she said. Martial law prohibits most men of military age from leaving the country, creating a need and space for female tech entrepreneurs at home and abroad. They are able to build on a stronger representation by women in leadership positions in Ukraine than in the European Union and globally. Some say they still face prejudice in the traditionally male-dominated tech industry however, or describe their struggles to run a business while adapting to life as a refugee and having to raise families alone with fathers still in Ukraine. Over the past decade, Ukraine has boasted one of eastern Europe's fastest growing tech hubs with startups attracting funding and clients from a large domestic market. Women were underrepresented however, making up only around 30% of managers in the professional, scientific and technical sector, whereas they occupied 40% of leadership positions in Ukraine overall in 2017-2022, according to a study by the United Nations Development Programme. The study highlighted that the proportion of Ukrainian women leaders nonetheless outstripped a figure of 35% for the European Union and 29% globally. Separate figures by Eurostat show around 17% of major tech jobs are held by women in the European Union. Reuters spoke to nearly a dozen venture capitalists, tech founders and industry officials to document the critical -- and often new -- roles women have played in driving a sector seen as key to Ukraine's economic prospects when the war ends. "Women's leadership within the tech sector has become more pronounced after the full-scale invasion," said Pavlo Kartashov, director of the Ukrainian Startup Fund (USF), a government-backed body that seeds startups. "We have witnessed a surge of female entrepreneurs who have stepped up to lead their companies and are driving growth." This rings especially true for ambitious startups looking to grow abroad, as many that have stayed in Ukraine focus on military or war-related technology such as drones, he added. TECH RESILIENCE The tech sector has proved resilient. While Ukraine's GDP plummeted nearly 30% in 2022, tech sector revenue rose nearly 1 percent to $7.97 billion and was forecast to increase to $8 billion in 2023, according to state statistics compiled by the Lviv Tech Cluster. The industry also accounts for nearly 5 percent of Ukraine's GDP with the number of tech specialists inside and outside Ukraine rising to 307,000 in 2023 from 285,000 in 2022. These numbers include the Lisbon-based founder of digital currency payment platform GeekPay. Veronica Korzh, who founded the startup three months after leaving Ukraine in February 2022, has witnessed a leap in female founders, due in part to increased access to investors outside Ukraine and accelerator programs targetting women funded by the EU, international bodies and tech multinationals. Many global bodies are out to boost women's representation in tech across the board, amid research showing firms with a higher proportion of women are more profitable, spend more on research and development and are more environmentally-minded, according to a report by the World Economic Forum. "I've seen more women starting companies after the war and taking on bigger positions because they can talk to investors and help develop brands to new customers," Korzh said. "This is also helping keep attention on Ukraine and spreading the word about the potential of its tech sector." For many tech workers, Poland is a first stop as it borders Ukraine and the countries have long business and cultural ties. Mykhailo Khaletskyi of the Polish-Ukrainian Startup Bridge - a group that provides grants, co-working space and other assistance said: "We see women driving new funding rounds and gaining experience that will help to establish new companies and attract international talent and funding," he said. Anastasiia Smyk, 27, an aeronautical engineer, launched her aviation operations management software company Input Soft outside Ukraine in Warsaw, where she tapped a burgeoning refugee tech community. Her product is now used in the United States, Latin America and Southeast Asia. "When talking to male investors, there were questions like 'Why were you appointed CEO of this company?' or 'Please share if you have any male business partners'" she said. But she fought against the prejudice. "My job was to find investments, recognition in the global market, and international clients who would become our early adopters, which was not easy for a no-name startup company from Ukraine," Smyk said. Looking at the startups founded by Ukrainian refugees she predicts many will return to the country when the war ends and give a huge boost. "I want to return to Ukraine to be part of the rebuilding and revitalization of our country... We are even open to working pro-bono just to see the first civil aircraft in Ukrainian skies as soon as possible," she said.

Thursday was a fine day to load up on computer chip and storage stocks. In the latter category, data storage mainstay Seagate Technology ( STX 2.05% ) had a bullish trading session, closing more than 1% higher against the S&P 500 index's 0.3% upward crawl. Seagate largely has one of its tech sector peers to thank for that. The Micron effect That peer is flash memory maker Micron Technology , which unveiled its latest set of quarterly results before market open. Happily for that company's shareholders and the elements of the tech sector affected by the memory market -- like Seagate's stock in trade, storage -- the results were impressive. Micron posted a heavy double-digit rise in revenue, while its non-GAAP (adjusted) operating profit flipped into the black. All things being equal, if the various chip segments in the tech sphere are doing well, storage also stands to gain. Robust demand for chips tends to indicate a hunger for more sophisticated products, and more sophisticated products tend to raise the need for larger-capacity and better storage solutions. It almost goes without saying at this point that much of the momentum behind such companies is due to the insatiable demand for artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. These require vastly more computing power, hence the need for cutting-edge processing hardware. Expand NASDAQ : STX Seagate Technology Plc Today's Change ( -2.05 %) $ -6.03 Current Price $ 287.96 Key Data Points Market Cap $63B Day's Range $ 283.69 - $ 296.03 52wk Range $ 63.19 - $ 296.03 Volume 171K Avg Vol 4.3M Gross Margin 36.86 % Dividend Yield 0.01 % A rosy, AI-powered future AI is only going to get more sophisticated in the coming months and years, and quickly. That should keep chip demand sustainably high, and storage solutions businesses like Seagate are poised to continue benefiting from the knock-on effect.

Home Technology Indian climate-tech sector sees $2.8 billion investment as mobility, energy lead March 21, 2024 1 min. read New Delhi, March 21 (IANS) The Indian climate-tech sector attracted $2.8 billion investment till November 30, 2023, representing 57 per cent of the total investment garnered in the previous year, a report showed on Thursday. The investment activity has been driven primarily by significant funding in the ‘mobility’ and ‘energy’ sub-sectors, which collectively secured over 94 per cent of the total climate-tech investments in India from 2019 till the end of November 2023. This dominant trend underscores the critical focus on these areas within the broader climate technology field, according to the report by consulting firm FSG. “It highlights the role climate innovation and sustainable practices play in our nation’s future, underscoring the importance of prioritising climate solutions in our national agenda,” said Rishi Agarwal, MD and Head-Asia at FSG. The overall investment growth in the climate-tech sector in recent years can be attributed to several key factors. “Primarily, there has been a significant rise in awareness among citizens, businesses, and governments regarding the importance of embracing sustainable practices,” the report stated. Additionally, the government has steadily enhanced incentives in the sector, sparking interest among investors. “Despite short-term fluctuations, the long-term growth trajectory of India’s climate-tech sector remains promising, underpinned by increasing awareness and government incentives,” said Agarwal. –IANS na/svn Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp Linkedin Email Telegram Flip Copy URL Previous article ‘Star Wars: The Acolyte’ debuts with first trailer Next article Gulshan Devaiah: Anurag Kashyap has contributed a great deal to my career RELATED ARTICLES Redmi 13 5G India launch on July 9: Key specs confirmed July 9, 2024 Maruti Suzuki trains 8.5K commercial drivers in post-accident emergency care April 30, 2024 FirstCry refiles papers for IPO to raise Rs 1,816 crore April 30, 2024 Latest Kareena Kapoor & Jeh’s UNSEEN BIRTHDAY VIDEO S A PURE JOY‑RIDE-Goes VIRAL AND Fans Are Going GAGA!

Chinese internet giant Tencent posts lowest annual profit since 2019 Tencent’s total net profit for last year stood at 115.2 billion yuan. (File pic) BEIJING : Chinese internet giant Tencent today posted its lowest annual profit since 2019, despite slight improvements recently in China’s economy and a more lenient attitude taken by regulators towards the tech sector. Tencent’s total net profit for 2023 stood at 115.2 billion yuan, according to a filing of annual results at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Decades of meteoric growth that turned China’s tech industry into one of the most dynamic in the world came to an abrupt halt in 2020, when Beijing introduced more stringent oversight measures. Authorities have since relaxed their approach to regulating the vital domestic tech sector as broader concerns about the health of China’s economy mount. Shenzhen-based Tencent – one of the world’s leading gaming firms and developer of China’s ubiquitous messaging and services app WeChat – saw its annual profit fall 16% in 2022 on the heels of a fresh crackdown on video game addiction among youth.

Tencent is one of the world's leading gaming firms and developer of China's ubiquitous messaging and services app WeChat AFP Chinese internet giant Tencent on Wednesday posted its lowest annual profit since 2019, despite slight improvements recently in China's economy and a more lenient attitude taken by regulators towards the tech sector. Tencent's total net profit for 2023 stood at 115.2 billion yuan ($16.0 billion), according to a filing of annual results at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Decades of meteoric growth that turned China's tech industry into one of the most dynamic in the world came to an abrupt halt in 2020, when Beijing introduced more stringent oversight measures. Authorities have since relaxed their approach to regulating the vital domestic tech sector as broader concerns about the health of China's economy mount. Tencent -- one of the world's leading gaming firms and developer of China's ubiquitous messaging and services app WeChat -- announced Wednesday 609.0 billion yuan ($84.6 billion) in total revenue in 2023, up 10 percent year-on-year. The Shenzhen-based firm also announced plans to increase the size of its share repurchasing scheme, more than doubling in 2024 from last year to "over HKD100 billion" ($12.8 billion), the filing said. In 2022, Tencent saw its annual profit fall 16 percent on the heels of a fresh crackdown by officials on video game addiction among youth. And despite more recent signs of vigour in the sector, the regulatory hurdle for new games remains "relatively large", Li Chengdong, founder of Beijing-based tech consultancy Dolphin, told AFP. New games in China must first obtain formal approval from authorities before being released. The issuance of all new game licences was frozen for nine months in 2021, and approvals have not since returned to the speed and reliability of previous years. "Even if (Tencent) develops new games, there's no guarantee it can distribute them," Li said. Tencent and several of its domestic competitors -- including Alibaba, Huawei and Baidu -- are now eyeing the promising field of artificial intelligence (AI). Last September, Tencent unveiled Hunyuan, an AI-powered chatbot intended to compete with the US's ChatGPT, whose services are not accessible in China. Wednesday's filing hailed Hunyuan as a "top-tier foundation model with superior performance in numerical reasoning, logical inference, and multi-turn conversations". But despite the push into AI, gaming still represents Tencent's most important business, Li told AFP, adding that "in the short term, there's not much expectation that the revenue from AI products could cover the costs". As many Chinese tech giants rush into AI, Tencent remains cautious about making big moves, Beijing-based tech expert Kevin Zhou told AFP. "(Tencent is) slower in pouring investment and could be up to one or two years behind the first movers," Zhou said. The firm is seeking to enhance its position in the video games sector by acquiring stakes in emerging studios, particularly in Europe. Tencent, founded in 1998 in the midst of China's rapid economic development, is a key player in the country's tech sector as the parent of the WeChat "super-app". WeChat is on most mobile phones in China, where it is used for a wide range of purposes including messaging, calling, digital payment and social media. China © Copyright AFP 2025.

SHARE Nigerian lender Unity Bank Plc is partnering with SkillPaddy in its “Count Her In” tech programme focused on empowering no fewer than 1000 female beneficiaries in software engineering training. The IT skill development and empowerment initiative is intended to bridge talent supply gaps while providing individuals with the opportunity to meet their training goals and launch careers in the tech industry. About 40 young girls will receive full sponsorship from Unity Bank for the special training initiative, which was conceived as part of activities to commemorate this year’s International Women’s Day 2024.

All beneficiaries of the programme will be trained on different aspects of software development and provided with mentorship and resources that they need to succeed, including life skills like critical thinking, communication, innovation, & problem-solving. Speaking on the partnership, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Unity Bank Plc, Mrs. Tomi Somefun, said the initiative aligns with the theme of the IWD 2024, #InspireInclusion, adding that empowering young women reflects the bank’s commitment to driving inclusion, equality, and diversity across industries. She stated, “As a bank committed to fostering economic empowerment and gender equality, we are proud to partner with SkillPaddy on this initiative to contribute to the training and empowerment of 1,000 female software engineers. Through this programme, we are not only investing in the future of these talented women but also driving innovation and diversity within the tech industry.

Image Woman working on a laptop - Credit: IgorTishenko / DepositPhotos - License: DepositPhotos Tech TechLeap start-ups tech sector Germany The United States » More tags « Less tags Sunday, 10 March 2024 - 07:45 Share this: Start-up organization says the government should become clients of up-and-coming firms Techleap, the Dutch organization providing assistance and advocacy for start-ups, says that the government should help new technological companies not only with subsidies, but by also becoming their clients. This was stated in a report about the state of the Dutch tech sector released earlier this week. Young innovative companies can grow more easily if they have the government as a client, said the interest group. The Netherlands is lagging behind in this regard, the organization said. Techleap drew a comparison with Germany. Of all start-ups that received their first 100,000 to 10 million euros in venture capital investments in that country, 32 percent managed to grow into a scale-up with more than 10 million euros in capital raised. In the Netherlands, 19 percent of start-ups succeeded. This meant that the scale-up share was also lower than in France and the United Kingdom, according to Techleap's annual report on the tech sector. The government can change this by paying for services from start-ups. The Netherlands would mainly have to focus on deep tech, the term for the first applications of discoveries at universities and research institutions. The government could follow the example of the United States, where the government acts as a "client of deep tech companies rather than their project manager." The association concluded from its own calculations that venture investments in this segment of the tech sector increased by about 15 percent in the Netherlands between 2022 and 2023. This is while total investments in the Dutch tech sector fell by 25 percent last year, partly due to higher interest rates and a weakening economy. Techleap said attracting and retaining highly trained personnel is a big problem for young, innovative companies. Although the vacancies are not rising as fast as in the last few years, the job market is very tight. Workers from abroad are vital for this reason, and they believe that the government should keep the Netherlands as an attractive place for immigrants. The start-up association has been lobbying for favorable tax arrangements for a long time. They also say a great deal can be done in the areas of diversity and inclusive thinking in the technological sector. A survey of employees showed that 45 percent of staff members in the tech sector with a non-Western background feel like they face bias and unfair treatment. Reporting by ANP

Title: Previewing the 2024 Q1 Earnings Season

Previewing the 2024 Q1 Earnings Season Sheraz Mian March 8, 2024 5 min read ^GSPC ADBE AZO The recent Costco COST and AutoZone AZO quarterly releases kick-started the 2024 Q1 earnings season. We have another four S&P 500 members on deck to report Q1 results this week, including Oracle ORCL on Monday, March 11 th , and Adobe ADBE on Thursday, March 14 th . The earnings reports from Costco and AutoZone and this week’s reports from Oracle and Adobe are for their respective fiscal quarters ending in February, which we and other research organizations count as part of the overall March-quarter or Q1 tally. In fact, by the time the big banks come out with their quarterly results on April 12 th , we will have Q1 results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members. Regular readers of our earnings commentary are familiar with our sanguine view of corporate profitability. We aren’t saying that the earnings picture is great, but we don’t agree with the doom-and-gloom projections either. Earnings growth remained under pressure in 2022 and through the first half of 2023 as a host of macro factors weighed on corporate profits. These factors included the post-COVID onset of inflationary pressures that compressed margins while the Fed’s extraordinary tightening moderated top-line growth. A loud segment of the commentariat saw these unfavorable trends culminating in a recession for the economy and a material hit to the overall earnings picture. However, the U.S. economy has proved resilient even as the Fed’s extraordinary tightening has put us on track for a happy resolution to the inflation issue. With the Fed now gearing up to start easing policy in the coming months, those extreme risks to the economy and corporate earnings have eased significantly. This is the macro backdrop in which we will receive the Q1 earnings results in the coming days. The expectation is that Q1 earnings will be up +2.4% from the same period last year on +3.5% higher revenues, following the +6.1% earnings growth on +2.6% revenue gains in the preceding period. The chart below shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for 2024 Q1 in the context of where growth has been over the preceding four quarters and what is currently expected for the following three quarters. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The chart below shows how Q1 earnings growth expectations have evolved since the quarter got underway. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Please note that while the revisions trend has been negative, the magnitude of cuts to Q1 estimates compares favorably to what we had seen in the comparable period for the preceding quarter (2023 Q4). Story Continues Since the start of Q1, estimates have come down for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest cuts to estimates for the Energy, Autos, Basic Materials, and Transportation sectors. Estimates have modestly increased over this period for 6 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the Retail, Consumer Discretionary, and Tech sectors enjoying notable positive revisions. Q1 earnings estimates for Oracle and Adobe that are reporting this week have largely remained unchanged since the quarter got underway. Embedded in current Q1 earnings and revenue estimates is a modest year-over-year decline in net margins, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research This chart shows that the extreme margin pressure we witnessed in 2022 and the first half of 2023 is now behind us. For 2024 Q1, net margins are expected to be below the year-earlier level for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines in the Energy, Basic Materials, Autos, and Medical sectors. Net margins are expected to be above the year-earlier level for 5 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest gains at the Tech and Utilities sectors. The Tech sector is now firmly back in the growth mode, and the trend is expected to continue going forward. For 2024 Q1, Tech sector earnings are expected to increase +18.9% from the same period last year on +7.9% higher revenues. This would follow the sector’s +27.4% higher earnings in 2023 Q4 on +8.5% higher revenues. The sector experienced a period of post-COVID adjustment in 2022 and the first half of 2023, during which time it became a drag on the aggregate growth picture. Please keep in mind that Tech isn’t just any other sector; it is the biggest earnings contributor to the S&P 500 index. The sector is currently expected to bring in 28.6% of the index’s total earnings over the coming four-quarter period, with the second and third biggest contributors being Finance and Medical, at 17.8% and 12.5%, respectively. This means that the Tech sector’s growth profile has a very big impact on the aggregate picture, both negatively and positively. The Tech sector dragged down the aggregate growth picture in 2022 and the first half of 2023 but now appears ready to resume its historically positive growth role. You can see this growth profile in the chart below, which also shows that the sector’s 2023 Q4 earnings tally of $158.2 billion was a new all-time quarterly record. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Please note that the Tech sector is instrumental in keeping the aggregate growth picture in positive territory in Q1. Excluding the sector’s substantial contribution, Q1 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -3% from the same period last year (vs. +2.4% as a whole). Looking at the overall earnings picture on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9.5% on +4.7% revenue growth.

by Marisha Singh March 8, 2024 Image credit: Getty Images The interview features Loubna Imenchal, head of Enterprise Business, for Africa, Middle East, Turkey and Central Asia region at Logitech, discussing her journey in the tech industry, challenges faced, and insights on women’s empowerment. Despite lacking a technical background, Loubna’s passion and resilience drove her to leadership roles, aiming to challenge gender norms. She reflects on overcoming imposter syndrome and highlights the joy of mentoring aspiring women in technology. Furthermore, she explores the future of technology and Logitech’s role in fostering inclusivity. Loubna emphasises the importance of purpose-driven innovation and encourages aspiring professionals to prioritise kindness and empathy in their endeavors. Listen to the full conversation on our podcast channel – Gulf Business on Spotify . Image credit: Supplied Excerpts: Q. Could you share your journey to becoming Head of Enterprise Business at Logitech? My journey spans over 25 years in multinational tech companies. Transitioning from a business administration background, I was driven by personal passion and the challenge to prove myself in the tech industry. Despite lacking a tech background, I pursued leadership roles, driven by a desire to empower women and leverage technology to enhance lives. Witnessing the impact of our solutions during Covid-19 pandemic reaffirmed the importance of our work in keeping people connected. Q. Reflecting on the challenges you faced, could you highlight one or two significant hurdles and how you overcame them? Initially, the tech industry presented challenges due to timing and societal norms. Being from Generation X, I encountered skepticism about my abilities due to a lack of technical background. Leadership positions were often reserved for those with specific technical expertise, sidelining qualified women. Overcoming these barriers required resilience and a commitment to challenging societal norms. While progress has been made, gender equality in tech remains elusive, necessitating continued advocacy and action. Q. Addressing the issue of imposter syndrome in women, have you experienced it in your career, and how did you navigate it? Imposter syndrome is undeniably real, particularly for women navigating male-dominated industries. Women often face internaliSed pressure to excel and fear failure, perpetuating a cycle of self-doubt. This phenomenon stems from societal expectations and ingrained gender biases, making it a pervasive challenge. Embracing vulnerability and reframing failure as opportunities for growth have been instrumental in overcoming imposter syndrome. Moreover, fostering a supportive environment that values diverse perspectives is crucial in empowering women to thrive. Q. On a positive note, could you share a significant achievement that brings you pride and joy? Teaching and mentoring aspiring women in technology has been incredibly rewarding. By advocating for inclusivity and challenging stereotypes, I’ve had the privilege of empowering the next generation of female leaders. Inspiring young women to pursue their passions, regardless of societal expectations, has been a profound source of fulfillment. Additionally, spearheading initiatives like the Connect and Elevate platform at Logitech underscores our commitment to fostering diversity and inclusion within the tech sector. Q. Considering the future of technology, what advancements do you believe will shape our world, and how does Logitech contribute to this evolution? Technology plays a pivotal role in empowering women by enabling flexibility and accessibility. Logitech’s innovative solutions facilitate remote work, education, and healthcare, empowering women to balance professional and personal responsibilities. By leveraging technology to bridge geographical barriers and enhance connectivity, we’re facilitating a more inclusive and equitable future. Our commitment to affordability and user-centric design ensures that these advancements are accessible to all, driving positive societal impact. Q. Finally, do you have any tech idols, and what advice would you offer young professionals aspiring to make an impact in the tech industry? Rather than idolising individuals, I admire those who harness technology to address societal needs and promote kindness. True innovation lies in addressing fundamental human challenges and fostering empathy and inclusivity. My advice to aspiring professionals is to prioritize purpose over accolades and to leverage technology as a force for positive change. By championing inclusivity and empathy, we can collectively shape a more equitable and compassionate tech industry.

Israel sees surge in women's representation in tech R&D, but gender gap persists ANI | Updated: Mar 08, 2024 15:09 IST ANI News Join our Whatsapp channel Tel Aviv [ Israel ], March 8 (ANI/TPS): The tech landscape in Israel has witnessed a surge in women 's participation in research and development ( R&D ) positions over the past decade, but gender parity remains elusive within the industry, with women occupying only a third of all high-tech positions according to a report released on Thursday. The report was released by the Israel Innovation Authority in collaboration with the Aaron Institute for Economic Policy at Reichman University ahead of International Women's Day, which is on Friday. "The tech sector has been at the forefront of the Israel i economy for many years, but there is still a way to go regarding gender equality. We see more women in core roles, but the growth rate is insufficient to reach gender parity goals," said Innovation Authority CEO Dror Bin. "In 2023, about 3,500 positions were added for women in tech compared to about 6,700 positions for men. To bring about change, there must be a concerted long-term effort by the tech industry and relevant government entities to continue breaking the glass ceiling for women earlier in their career." The report found that almost 40 per cent of women currently employed in the tech industry are engaged in R&D roles, marking a staggering 130 per cent increase since 2013. This upward trajectory reflects a consistent annual growth rate of 2.7 per cent, in line with that of men. However, women still only occupy a third of all high-tech positions, falling short of the 43% target set by the National High-Tech Human Capital Committee, for 2035. This gap is particularly pronounced for non-Orthodox Jewish women , with approximately 80,000 positions needed to meet the designated target. Moreover, the proportion of women in administrative and business development roles has decreased from 50.7 per cent in 2014 to 41.4 per cent in 2024, demonstrating an 18% decline in the last decade. "From the research data, it is evident that gender gaps in tech positions and the tech industry's R&D positions are not a result of differences in ability or achievements between men and women , but rather stem from different choices made by them at various stages of the education system," said Dr. Sergei Sumkin, a senior researcher at the Aaron Institute. "Access to tech studies should be provided to every student in Israel within the school framework or excellence centers. Additionally, attention should be paid to the professional explanation by the school staff regarding the contribution of tech skills to quality employment for female students," Sumkin added.

Title: 1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks Alphabet Stock Is Going to $170 . Is It a Buy Around $130 ?

Article Content:
As the seemingly eternal leader in internet search, Google parent Alphabet ( GOOG +0.29% ) ( GOOGL +0.31% ) has made a great many investors richer over the course of its more than 25-year history. Lately, though, it hasn't been the most exciting stock, neither soaring higher nor crashing violently in price on the tech sector's gyrations. Some believe it's being unfairly ignored by the market, and the market is missing a chance to get a solid investment at a cheap price. Let's explore one analyst's bullish take on the company. Undervalued and underappreciated As February came to a close, Redburn-Atlantic's James Cordwell upped his price target on Alphabet's class A voting shares (the ones with the GOOGL ticker symbol). These should be worth $170 apiece, according to him, up from his previous level of $165. In making his change, Cordwell maintained his buy rating on the shares. That makes for a potential gain of around 30% on both classes of Alphabet's stock, given that they're hovering around the $130 level these days and they trade at basically the same level. Cordwell feels that Alphabet is priced more like a traditional blue chip stock in an unexciting industry than a leader dominating a corner of the tech sector. He wrote in a note that with "Alphabet's forward P/E now just in line with that of the [ S&P 500 index] sentiment has clearly turned negative regarding Google Search's competitive position and ongoing growth potential." Expand NASDAQ : GOOGL Alphabet Today's Change ( 0.31 %) $ 0.90 Current Price $ 291.00 Key Data Points Market Cap $3501B Day's Range $ 287.33 - $ 291.90 52wk Range $ 140.53 - $ 291.92 Volume 793K Avg Vol 34M Gross Margin 59.18 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % Taken for granted? It can be tough for a company that's been so firmly established in its niche to win investor love. With longevity, more people can take a business for granted and forget that it still might have powerful growth in front of it. Technological advances will make internet search more of a valuable resource, not less, and there's no meaningful competition to the powerhouse that is Alphabet. That makes Cordwell's latest take on the stock rather compelling and $130 looks like a cheap price for a company with a bright future.

Money Report In partnership with News Asia's tech industry is recovering on chip boom amid global economic uncertainty, JPMorgan says By Sheila Chiang,CNBC • Published March 5, 2024 • Updated on March 5, 2024 at 9:20 pm BOOKMARKER Mike Kemp | In Pictures | Getty Images While we are not seeing a broader based recovery in non-tech sectors, the tech sector has been recovering, said JPMorgan. "Asia has done reasonably well in the second half of last year. China industry benefited, North Asia obviously benefited more from it," said Bruce Kasman, chief economist for JPMorgan, in a media briefing on Tuesday. But the recovery is not uniform across all components in tech, said JPMorgan, naming the semiconductor industry as the bright spot amid the AI boom. SINGAPORE – Asia-Pacific's tech sector has been growing on the back of the semiconductor boom even as other industries struggle amid global macro uncertainty, according to investment bank JPMorgan. Stream Los Angeles News for free, 24/7, wherever you are. WATCH HERE "Tech has been recovering, that's why Asia has done reasonably well in the second half of last year. China industry benefited, North Asia obviously benefited more from it," Bruce Kasman, chief economist at JPMorgan said in a media briefing on Tuesday. The tech sector, which thrived during the Covid-19 pandemic as companies accelerated their digitalization efforts, underwent a slowdown in 2022 and 2023 as high inflation and interest rates softened consumer spending, hit product demand and led to layoffs. Global tech spending weakened in 2023 while layoffs rose, said Deloitte in a report on tech industry's 2024 outlook . "But there are now glimmers of hope that a tech comeback may be imminent: Economists have lowered their assessments of recession risk, and analysts are optimistic that the tech sector could return to modest growth in 2024," Deloitte said. The recovery in tech is significant as other industries are still struggling. "Even though we have seen recovery in tech, we are not seeing a broader based recovery in the non-tech sectors," said Ong Sin Beng, head of EM Asia economics research at JPMorgan, on Tuesday. Money Report Crime and Courts Nov 9 $10,000 in merchandise stolen from Glendale streetwear store Retail Nov 6 CHP makes arrests in $900,000 California home improvement store theft operation The artificial intelligence boom continues to boost chipmakers and is driving tech growth. U.S. chip design firm Nvidia saw a 265% jump in fourth-quarter revenue , thanks to skyrocketing demand for its graphics processing units, thousands of which are used to run and train OpenAI's ChatGPT . But the recovery is not uniform across the tech sector, JPMorgan said, singling out the semiconductor industry as the bright spot amid the AI boom. "It is primarily in the semiconductor, dynamic random access memory sector. So we are seeing, for example, Korean production doing quite well. Taiwan is because of the logic chips we are seeing that do relatively well. So those are the two key beneficiaries in North Asia," Ong said. Taiwan's TSMC is the primary contract chip manufacturer for Nvidia and has benefited from Nvidia's performance and potential. South Korean DRAM chip makers such as Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix have also benefited from the AI boom as large language models like ChatGPT require high-performance memory chips to generate human-like responses. "Our equity analysts who oversee the sector remain quite positive simply because it's built out of broader digitization, data centers, AI, etc," Ong said. He also said Singapore was "certainly seeing that lift" from the semiconductor boom. The country manufactures 20% of global chip equipment , according to data shared at the Singapore Semiconductor Industry Association Semiconductor Business Connect 2022. Last month, Singapore's deputy prime minister, Lawrence Wong, said in his Budget speech that the country will invest more than 1 billion Singapore dollars ($743 million) over the next five years to further boost the country's AI capabilities. As part of the investment, Singapore will work to ensure it can secure access to the advanced chips "that are so crucial to AI development and deployment," Wong said.

Washington, Mar 5 (PTI) Ravi Kumar S, the CEO of Cognizant, has joined the US-India Strategic and Partnership Forum as a member of its board of directors, it was announced on Tuesday. “Ravi is a doyen in the tech industry and is a foremost thought leader who has unparalleled insights on the dynamic and fast-changing nature of the tech sector,” USISPF president and CEO Mukesh Aghi said in an announcement. In an era of a digital-first economy and digital trade, Cognizant’s work through the years exemplifies the burgeoning collaboration in the US-India technology partnership success story, he said. India's robust tech talent remains pivotal in fortifying and expanding the tech sector within the United States, Aghi said. Congratulating Ravi, USISPF Chairman John Chambers said the Cognizant CEO is an accomplished leader in IT services, and his broad experience in the industry – touching digital transformation, engineering services, data analytics, and more – puts him in the top calibre of experts supporting innovation in this space, particularly in India. “Cognizant’s role in strengthening the tech ties between the US and India is clear, demonstrated by the company’s integral role in India's near $200 billion software exports for 2023,” he said. “I am honoured to join the USISPF Board of Directors. At Cognizant, I have the honour of leading an American company which is India’s second-largest employer among multinationals. Seventy per cent of our nearly 350,000 employees live in India, and I believe that their work is the critical cog on the tech talent wheel that will help drive economic success for both countries,” Ravi said. “This is the mission to which the USISPF has dedicated itself and I am thrilled to help author the story of our nations’ mutual success,” he said.

Command Line AI Tech Google’s morale crisis is about to get worse The layoffs keep rolling, Gemini is in trouble, and now Google employees are bracing for lower raises. The layoffs keep rolling, Gemini is in trouble, and now Google employees are bracing for lower raises. by Alex Heath Mar 4, 2024, 3:49 AM UTC Link Share Alex Heath is a contributing writer and author of the Sources newsletter. Last week was a tough one inside Google, and based on what I’m hearing, this coming week won’t be much better. More on that below… An archive of past issues is also available online . If you aren’t already subscribed, sign up here to get future issues in your inbox. A rough start to the Gemini era When CEO Sundar Pichai proclaimed that Google was entering its “Gemini era” late last year, this was not the reaction he was hoping for: The Verge The last thing a company like Google wants is to be in the middle of a culture war, especially when it involves your highest priority product. Pichai rarely weighs in on specific controversies. But he told the whole company last week that the scandal was “completely unacceptable.” There’s a new level of urgency on the inside. Pichai and Google co-founder Sergey Brin were spotted in tense meetings at the company’s Mountain View headquarters last week. Friday was supposed to be a day off for most employees but management instead called for volunteers over the weeked to be on stand-by “so we can activate rapid adversarial testing on high priority topics.” The simplest way to explain this mess is that a team at Google was too heavy-handed with prompt engineering for photo generation. This is an industry standard technique that involves inserting extra words into a prompt behind the scenes — and without the user’s knowledge — that is then sent to the AI model to produce a more acceptable result. This kind of prompt engineering is relatively easy to undo, and Google has already said that photo generation should be back online in a couple of weeks. The harder thing to fix will be the text-based responses of Gemini are problematic, like when it suggested that Elon Musk was a worse person than Adolf Hitler . There’s also the obvious political bias to contend with. During a random appearance at an AI hacker house over the weekend, Sergey Brin admitted that “we haven’t fully understood” why the model “leans left.” After talking to sources at Google, I’ve come to the conclusion that these bad Gemini responses slipped through testing because everyone felt rushed to ship. An illustrative example: the photo generation in the Gemini app is not actually powered by the Gemini model. It’s an older, text-to-photo model that was tacked onto the Gemini user-facing experience to get the feature out the door faster. I’m told that there’s also a lack of alignment between Demis Hassabis’ research team building the underlying models and Prabhakar Raghavan’s search organization that’s putting them into user-facing products. Perhaps the coming “structural changes” Pichai hinted at in his memo to employees last week will address that. More bad news Elsewhere in the Googleplex, I’ve learned that layoffs hit CMO Lorraine Twohill’s marketing organization and the Play Store team last week. These are in addition to the layoffs that have been already reported in trust and safety and YouTube . Google spokesperson Courtenay Mencini declined to comment on any specifics but said the company is focusing on “reducing bureaucracy and layers” and giving “employees more opportunity to work on our most innovative and important advances.” Pichai has at least been clear that these quiet, org-specific layoffs will continue for a while, which contributes to deflated morale and a general feeling of unease. But Google’s leaders have been much less upfront about more difficult news that the rank and file will hear this coming week, when managers begin sharing the results of annual performance reviews. While most employees will still be getting an overall increase to their compensation, the majority won’t be getting anywhere near as much of an increase as they have in years prior, according to internal emails and documents shared with managers that I’ve seen. For the “significant impact” rating that the majority of employees are assigned by their managers, there will be no salary increase in most cases. A key talking point shared with managers is that, this year, the company is more closely anchoring pay to “local benchmarks” — essentially the compensation for similar jobs at other companies in the same geographic area. In a lengthy slide deck shared with managers this week to help them talk about performance reviews with their reports, they are encouraged to focus on “the big picture, which is the macro economy, the state of tech” and “how Google fits into that landscape.” “Because we have a market-based pay philosophy, Googlers in roles and locations with the highest competition for talent will be modeled for increases comparable to recent years,” a Google HR exec told managers in an email that I saw. “But as we continue to align our pay to local markets, some modeled comp awards may be lower than last year’s for some Googlers. Managers will have additional discretionary funds to help reward strong performers you want to recognize and encourage, but the additional discretionary funds may be more modest than in previous years, particularly for bonuses.” The email also says that “Googlers in some roles and locations will see slightly lower equity refresh awards this cycle.” When Google revamped its performance review system in 2022, employees were told that it would lead to a higher increase in pay for most people. In retrospect, it seems designed to cut costs by forcing more people into lower rating tiers, according to multiple managers I’ve spoken with. “We continue to offer extremely competitive pay across salary, equity, leave, and a broader suite of benefits,” Google’s Mencini told me. Yes, there is a “sad violin” element to all of this that should be acknowledged. I’m sympathetic to the notion that Google employees should be pleased they are getting any raises at all given the mass layoffs that have swept across tech. At the same time, raises being lower than last year will further hurt morale. As one Google manager predicted to me last week: “I expect once comp [news] drops you’ll see a whole lot of uproar from the ranks, especially toward Sundar.” People moves Some interesting career moves I’ve noticed recently: Sridhar Ramaswamy , Google’s former head of ads and the ex-CEO of the search startup Neeva, is the new CEO of Snowflake, replacing Frank Slootman . Asha Sharma , the former COO of Instacart, has joined Microsoft to lead product for its AI platform group. Hugo Swart , Qualcomm’s VP of AR and VR, is leaving after two decades at the company for a “new journey.” Adam Presser is the new head of trust and safety at TikTok, reporting to CEO Shou Chew . He’ll replace Cormac Keenan , who will stay on as an advisor. Interesting links NPR’s deep dive into Marc Benioff’s ​​Hawaii empire. Ming-Chi Kuo’s latest research note on Vision Pro sales . The CTRL-labs team at Meta published a research paper on building a “noninvasive neuromotor interface for human-computer interaction.” I’ll be at SXSW next weekend, please let me know if you’ll be in Austin too and would like to meet up (or know of any parties I should stop by).

US prices increased less than expected in February, with the cost of services outside housing and energy slowing significantly, keeping a June interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve on the table. The report from the Commerce Department on Friday also showed consumer spending rising by the most in just over a year last month, underscoring the economy’s resilience. The United States continues to outperform its global peers despite higher borrowing costs, thanks to persistent labor market strength. “Core services inflation is slowing and will likely continue throughout the year,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. “By the time the Fed meets in June, the data should be convincing enough for them to commence its rate normalisation process.” The personal consumption expenditures price index rose 0.3 percent last month, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis said. Data for January was revised higher to show the PCE price index climbing 0.4 percent instead of 0.3 percent as previously reported. Goods prices rose 0.5 percent last month, boosted by a 3.4 percent jump in the cost of gasoline and other energy products. ADVERTISEMENT There were also strong increases in the prices of recreational goods and vehicles as well as clothing and footwear. But prices for furnishings and household equipment, and other long-lasting manufactured goods were subdued. In the 12 months through February, PCE inflation advanced 2.5 percent after increasing 2.4 percent in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PCE price index gaining 0.4 percent on the month. Though price pressures are subsiding, the pace has slowed from the first half of last year. Fed officials last week left the US central bank’s policy rate unchanged in the current 5.25 percent -5.50 percent range, having raised it by 525 basis points since March 2022. Policymakers anticipate three rate cuts this year. Financial markets expect the first rate reduction in June. Fed Governor Christopher Waller said on Wednesday, “there is no rush to cut the policy rate” right now, but he did not rule out trimming borrowing costs later in the year. Most US financial markets were closed for the Good Friday holiday, with the exception of the foreign exchange market. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies on the data. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index increased 0.3 percent last month. That followed an upwardly revised 0.5 percent gain in January. The so-called core PCE price index was previously reported to have advanced 0.4 percent in January. Core inflation increased 2.8 percent year-on-year in February, the smallest gain since March 2021, after rising 2.9 percent in January. The Fed tracks the PCE price measures for its 2 percent inflation target. Monthly inflation readings of 0.2 percent over time are necessary to bring inflation back to target. ADVERTISEMENT Services prices increased 0.3 percent, slowing after a 0.6 percent jump in January. The cost of housing and utilities rose 0.5 percent. There were also solid increases in the prices of recreation services as well as financial services and insurance. But the cost of dining out and hotel and motel rooms was unchanged, while transportation services barely rose and healthcare increased marginally. PCE services inflation excluding energy and housing gained 0.2 percent last month after surging 0.7 percent in January. Policymakers are monitoring the so-called super core inflation to gauge their progress in fighting inflation. With inflation slowing consumers boosted their spending. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, jumped 0.8 percent last month. That as the largest gain since January 2023 and followed a 0.2 percent rise in January. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rebounded 0.4 percent after dropping 0.2 percent in January. The increase in the so-called real consumer spending suggested that consumption likely retained most of its momentum in the first quarter, which bodes well for the economy’s prospects. But much of the spending was funded from savings as growth in personal income slowed. The saving rate dropped to 3.6 percent, the lowest level since December 2022, from 4.1 percent in January.

CNN - Business/Consumer By CNN Newsource Published March 29, 2024 5:37 am By Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN New York (CNN) — The latest US inflation report showed that rising prices continue to weigh on American consumers. The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, was up 2.5% for the 12 months that ended in February, a faster pace than January’s 2.4% rise in prices . However, it was in line with FactSet consensus estimates. Driving the increase in the annual inflation rate was a 2.3% jump last month in energy prices. The Commerce Department data released Friday means the Fed is even further from achieving its goal of 2% inflation. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell wasn’t fretting about it. The data was “pretty much in line with our expectations,” Powell said Friday at an event hosted by the San Francisco Fed. He added that it’s generally good when data aligns with the central bank’s forecasts. The report also contained some welcome news. Central bankers will likely take some solace in the core PCE index that excludes energy and food. That index slowed slightly to 2.8% from the 2.9% annual rate seen in January. And, on a monthly basis, it slowed to 0.3% from 0.5% in January. Both core inflation measures were in line with expectations. Another bright spot was the 0.3% overall monthly pace of price increases, a slight drop from 0.4% in January. That was below what economists polled by FactSet forecast. At 0.5%, the monthly rise in the price of goods outpaced the 0.3% rise in the price of services. That’s significant because service-side inflation has been a huge driver of overall inflation in the economy for the past two years. The Fed’s historic rate increases that pushed interest rates to a 23-year high have had a limited effect on containing increases in the price of services. That’s because those price increases have been stemming from labor shortages, and to attract more workers employers have had to raise wages. In turn, that’s caused them to also raise prices. Consumer spending staged a huge comeback Although recent economic data has pointed to a slowdown in consumer spending, Friday’s PCE data showed the opposite effect. Consumer spending accelerated by 0.8% last month from 0.2% in January. That’s the biggest monthly rise in over a year. While consumer spending is the main economic engine of the US economy, the run-up may not be something to celebrate right now. “This underscores that consumers have overextended themselves and have essentially drawdown all of the $2.1 trillion in pandemic-related savings,” Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic said in a note on Friday. That’s evidenced by credit card debt , which is at a record high. “As long as employment growth remains strong, it can underpin solid spending, however, consumers overall are not prepared for a weakening in the labor market should it unfold,” she said. More rate cut delays? The latest inflation data is unlikely to shift the Fed’s plans for eventually cutting interest rates. Central bankers including Powell have signaled that achieving 2% inflation will be a bumpy path. Fed Gov. Christopher Waller emphasized that in a speech he gave earlier this week titled “There’s Still No Rush.” Recent inflation readings, he said, tell him that “it is prudent to hold this rate at its current restrictive stance perhaps for longer than previously thought to help keep inflation on a sustainable trajectory toward 2%.” Fed officials continued to pencil in three rate cuts this year. Investors anticipate the first of those three will come in June. The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All rights reserved.

People walk past the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Peter Morgan/Associated Press Stocks wrapped up a monster first quarter on a subdued note Thursday, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posting double-digit gains the first three months of 2024 – powered by investors’ optimism about the state of the economy. The S&P 500 gained 10.8% in the first quarter, continuing a rally that began in late 2023 and notching its strongest start to the year since 2019. The tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 10.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also notched a respectable first quarter with a gain of 5.5%, which analysts took as a welcome sign that the current rally isn’t wholly dependent on Big Tech. The market surge is driven by the continued strength of the economy, with consumers continuing to open up their wallets, analysts said. “Underscored by a solid economic landscape and strong labor market coupled with resilient consumer spending, the Dow has powered ahead to post new highs,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial. Advertisement The Dow closed at 39,807 Thursday, up 0.1% for the day and setting a record. The S&P 500 closed at 5,254, up 0.1% for the day, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 0.1% to close at 16,379. The strong quarter for all three indexes extends gains in the final months of 2023, when a cadre of Big Tech stocks dubbed the Magnificent Seven pulled the market higher. Companies that benefited from the hype around advancements in artificial intelligence wowed Wall Street the most, specifically Microsoft and Nvidia. But the market’s performance so far in 2024 has also broadened the rally. The Dow, which includes 30 large companies traded on U.S. stock exchanges ― so-called blue-chip companies, including Apple, Boeing, Nike and Walmart – is a closely watched bellwether of how the stock market is doing. Because it excludes several of the Magnificent Seven, some analysts consider it to be more representative of the U.S. economy itself ― “Main Street America’s favored index,” as Krosby puts it. The Dow’s strength suggests the current rally in stocks might have staying power, analysts said. The success of the Dow “indicates prosperity in this country, and an expanding economy,” said Michael Farr of the Washington, D.C.-based investment firm Farr, Miller and Washington. Advertisement One factor behind the Dow’s strong performance was a rally among companies linked to the financial sector, which accounted for almost half of its increase for the quarter, Farr said. American Express and insurance company Travelers have each gained about 20% since the start of the year; Goldman Sachs climbed more than 7%; and JPMorgan finished the quarter up by about 16%. The rally in the financial sector is supported in large part by the fact that consumer spending has held up better than expected, said Wayne Wicker of MissionSquare Retirement. “The resilience of the economy is an upside surprise for investors this year. … The economy remains vibrant, and consumer spending continues to drive forward,” Wicker said. Looking ahead, investors will be closely watching the path of interest rates as well. The Federal Reserve is keeping rates at their current high until they see more evidence of inflation coming down. But the central bank is expected to pursue three rate cuts in 2024.

Peter Morgan/Associated Press Stocks wrapped up a monster first quarter on a subdued note Thursday, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posting double-digit gains the first three months of 2024 – powered by investors’ optimism about the state of the economy. The S&P 500 gained 10.8% in the first quarter, continuing a rally that began in late 2023 and notching its strongest start to the year since 2019. The tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 10.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also notched a respectable first quarter with a gain of 5.5%, which analysts took as a welcome sign that the current rally isn’t wholly dependent on Big Tech. The market surge is driven by the continued strength of the economy, with consumers continuing to open up their wallets, analysts said. “Underscored by a solid economic landscape and strong labor market coupled with resilient consumer spending, the Dow has powered ahead to post new highs,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial. Advertisement The Dow closed at 39,807 Thursday, up 0.1% for the day and setting a record. The S&P 500 closed at 5,254, up 0.1% for the day, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 0.1% to close at 16,379. The strong quarter for all three indexes extends gains in the final months of 2023, when a cadre of Big Tech stocks dubbed the Magnificent Seven pulled the market higher. Companies that benefited from the hype around advancements in artificial intelligence wowed Wall Street the most, specifically Microsoft and Nvidia. But the market’s performance so far in 2024 has also broadened the rally. The Dow, which includes 30 large companies traded on U.S. stock exchanges ― so-called blue-chip companies, including Apple, Boeing, Nike and Walmart – is a closely watched bellwether of how the stock market is doing. Because it excludes several of the Magnificent Seven, some analysts consider it to be more representative of the U.S. economy itself ― “Main Street America’s favored index,” as Krosby puts it. The Dow’s strength suggests the current rally in stocks might have staying power, analysts said. The success of the Dow “indicates prosperity in this country, and an expanding economy,” said Michael Farr of the Washington, D.C.-based investment firm Farr, Miller and Washington. Advertisement One factor behind the Dow’s strong performance was a rally among companies linked to the financial sector, which accounted for almost half of its increase for the quarter, Farr said. American Express and insurance company Travelers have each gained about 20% since the start of the year; Goldman Sachs climbed more than 7%; and JPMorgan finished the quarter up by about 16%. The rally in the financial sector is supported in large part by the fact that consumer spending has held up better than expected, said Wayne Wicker of MissionSquare Retirement. “The resilience of the economy is an upside surprise for investors this year. … The economy remains vibrant, and consumer spending continues to drive forward,” Wicker said. Looking ahead, investors will be closely watching the path of interest rates as well. The Federal Reserve is keeping rates at their current high until they see more evidence of inflation coming down. But the central bank is expected to pursue three rate cuts in 2024.

The US economy grew faster than previously estimated in the fourth quarter, boosted by strong consumer spending and business investment in nonresidential structures like factories and healthcare facilities. The report from the Commerce Department on Thursday also showed profits rising at a solid clip last quarter, driven by nonfinancial corporations. Increasing profits, together with rising worker productivity, could encourage companies to retain their employees. Labour market resilience is underpinning consumer spending, keeping the economy afloat despite dire predictions of a recession in the aftermath of 525 basis points worth of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve since March 2022 to quell inflation. “The consumer will be front and centre when it comes to gauging the strength left in this recovery, and their spending that has shifted to services will be critical this year,” said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. Gross domestic product increased at a 3.4% annualised rate last quarter, revised up from the previously reported 3.2% pace, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its third estimate of fourth-quarter GDP. The revision reflected upgrades in consumer spending, business investment as well as state and local government spending, which offset downgrades to inventory accumulation and exports. Economists polled by Reuters had expected GDP growth would be unrevised. The economy is growing above what US central bank officials regard as the non-inflationary growth rate of 1.8% and continues to outperform its global peers. The economy grew at a 4.9% pace in the July-September quarter. It expanded 2.5% in 2023, an acceleration from 1.9% in 2022. Growth estimates for the first quarter are converging around a 2.0% pace. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, increased at a 3.3% rate, adding 2.20 percentage points to GDP growth. It was previously estimated to have grown at a 3.0% pace. The upward revision was in services. The upgrade to business spending reflected higher outlays on manufacturing as well as commercial and healthcare structures than previously estimated. Spending on intellectual property products was also revised up, while the decline in outlays on equipment was not as steep as previously estimated. Corporate profits including inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments increased $133.5bn in the fourth quarter after rising $108.7bn in the July-September quarter. Profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations increased$136.5bn, while those of financial corporations rose $5.9bn. That more than offset an $8.9bn decline in profits from the rest of the world. When measured from the income side, the economy expanded at a robust 4.8% rate. Gross domestic income (GDI) increased at a 1.9% pace in the July-September quarter. In principle, GDP and GDI should be equal, but in practice differ as they are estimated using different and largely independent source data. A widening gap between GDI and GDP in prior quarters had raised concerns among some economists that the economy was not as strong as suggested by the GDP figures. The surge in GDI reflected higher wages and profits. The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 4.1% rate last quarter after advancing at a 3.4% pace in the third quarter. A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 210,000 for the week ended March 23. Economists had forecast 212,000 claims in the latest week. Claims have been hovering in a 200,000-213,000 range since February. Most employers are retaining their workers despite a rash of high-profile layoffs at the start of the year. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, increased 24,000 to 1.819mn during the week ending March 16, the claims report showed. The so-called continuing claims covered the period during which the government surveyed households for March’s unemployment rate. Continuing claims were little changed between the February and March survey periods. The unemployment rate was at 3.9% in February.

Summary The latest revisions put Q4 GDP at 3.4%, the second fastest quarterly growth rate in two years. Much of the upside was attributable to stronger consumer spending, yet fresh profits data affirmed it was a good quarter for the bottom line as well with profits up by the most since the Q2-2022. Hindsight 2024 In its latest revision to fourth quarter GDP, the Commerce Department flagged growth during the period at 3.4%, which is a faster clip than previous estimates (chart). With the benefit of even more hindsight, consumer spending is now pegged at an annualized growth rate of 3.3% up from just 3.0% previously (chart). What drove the adjustment higher was a better finish than expected for services outlays. While it may be encouraging to see sustained consumer spending growth in this sector, the staying power could be problematic for the Fed should the sustained demand there prevent a cooling in service prices. Tomorrow will bring monthly data for February on PCE inflation; we already know from the January report that the trend decline in services inflation has been interrupted. Structures spending jumped to 3.7% from 2.4% in the prior estimate on upward revisions to private nonresidential construction spending. One theme we've highlighted is how a boom in manufacturing construction has scope to lift future output capacity. In the meantime it can be supportive to topline growth through stronger structures investment. Residential fixed investment growth was revised lower by a tenth of a percent.

WRAPUP 2-US economy continues to shine with help from consumers, labor market "It is operating on a more even keel than during the pandemic and its immediate aftermath." Gross domestic product increased at a 3.4% annualized rate last quarter, revised up from the previously reported 3.2% pace, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its third estimate of fourth-quarter GDP. The revision reflected upgrades in consumer spending, business investment as well as state and local government spending, which offset downgrades to inventory accumulation and exports. Reuters | Updated: 28-03-2024 22:30 IST | Created: 28-03-2024 22:30 IST SHARE The U.S. economy grew faster than previously estimated in the fourth quarter, boosted by strong consumer spending and business investment in nonresidential structures like factories and healthcare facilities. The report from the Commerce Department on Thursday also showed profits rising at a solid clip last quarter, driven by nonfinancial corporations. Increasing profits, together with rising worker productivity, could encourage companies to retain their employees, and extend the economic expansion. The economy has shrugged off fearmongering about a recession following 525 basis points worth of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve since March 2022 to quell inflation. Though momentum has slowed, it continues to outpace its global peers. The report, which also showed underlying inflation pressures easing last quarter, did not change expectations that the U.S. central bank will start cutting rates by June. "The economy is in good shape," said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank in Dallas. "It is operating on a more even keel than during the pandemic and its immediate aftermath." Gross domestic product increased at a 3.4% annualized rate last quarter, revised up from the previously reported 3.2% pace, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its third estimate of fourth-quarter GDP. The revision reflected upgrades in consumer spending, business investment as well as state and local government spending, which offset downgrades to inventory accumulation and exports. Economists polled by Reuters had expected GDP growth would be unrevised. The economy is growing faster than the 1.8% pace Fed officials regard as the non-inflationary rate of growth. It grew at a 4.9% pace in the July-September quarter, and expanded 2.5% in 2023, an acceleration from 1.9% in 2022. Growth estimates for the first quarter are around a 2.0% pace. The increase in core inflation last quarter was trimmed to a 2.0% rate from a 2.1% pace. Stocks on Wall Street were little changed ahead of the Good Friday holiday. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed. CONSUMER SPENDING UPGRADED Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 3.3% rate, adding 2.20 percentage points to GDP growth. It was previously estimated to have grown at a 3.0% pace. The upward revision was in services. The upgrade to business spending reflected higher outlays on manufacturing as well as commercial and healthcare structures than previously estimated. Spending on intellectual property products was also revised up, while the decline in outlays on equipment was not as steep as previously estimated. Inventory investment was lowered to a $54.9 billion rate from the previously estimated $66.3 billion pace. While that subtracted 0.47 percentage point from GDP growth, the outlook for this year is encouraging. Stronger consumer spending last year and expectations for a moderation this year likely resulted in the slower pace of inventory accumulation. "We anticipate that inventory accumulation will stabilize, then begin to pick up again over the next few years," said Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. "That turn in the inventory cycle will help support GDP growth this year and make the slowdown gradual." Nearly all industries contributed to growth last quarter, with nondurable goods manufacturing leading the charge, followed by retail trade, durable goods manufacturing and healthcare and social assistance. But agriculture, wholesale trade and arts, entertainment and recreation were minor drags. Corporate profits including inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments increased $133.5 billion after rising $108.7 billion in the July-September quarter. Profits of domestic nonfinancial firms increased $136.5 billion, while those of financial institutions rose $5.9 billion, more than offsetting an $8.9 billion decline in profits from the rest of the world. Profit margins were solid. "While firms have generally pulled back on making large capital expenditures, decent year-end profitability suggests businesses entered 2024 in adequate financial shape," said Shannon Grein, an economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte, North Carolina. "To the extent continued profitability enables hiring, spending could be sustained." Higher profits together with fairly strong wage gains boosted the income side of the growth ledger. Gross domestic income (GDI) grew at a robust 4.8% rate after increasing at a 1.9% pace in the July-September quarter. In principle, GDP and GDI should be equal, but in practice differ as they are estimated using different and largely independent source data. The sharp narrowing in the gap between GDP and GDI should assuage concerns that the economy's health was being overstated. The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 4.1% rate last quarter after advancing at a 3.4% pace in the third quarter. A separate report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 210,000 for the week ended March 23. Economists had forecast 212,000 claims in the latest week. Claims have been hovering in a 200,000-213,000 range since February despite a rash of high-profile layoffs at the start of the year.

The so-called continuing claims covered the period during which the government surveyed households for March's unemployment rate. Continuing claims were little changed between the February and March survey periods. The unemployment rate was at 3.9% in February. "The labor market is becoming better balanced between demand for and supply of workers, which will help moderate upward wages pressures," said Stuart Hoffman, senior economic advisor at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The total net worth of the top 1%, defined by the Fed as those with wealth over $11 million, increased by $2 trillion in the fourth quarter. All of the gains came from their stock holdings. The value of corporate equities and mutual fund shares held by the top 1% surged to $19.7 trillion from $17.65 trillion the previous quarter. Create a free account with NBC 5 DFW to save articles and videos. LEARN MORE While their real estate values went up slightly, the value of their privately held businesses declined, essentially canceling out all other gains outside of stocks. The quarterly gain marked the latest addition to an unprecedented wealth boom that began in 2020 with the Covid-19 pandemic market surge. Since 2020, the wealth of the top 1% has increased by nearly $15 trillion, or 49%. Middle-class Americans have also seen a rising wealth tide, with the middle 50% to 90% of Americans seeing their wealth increase 50%. Economists say the rising stock market is giving an added boost to consumer spending through what is known as the "wealth effect." When consumers and investors see their stock holdings soar, they feel more confident spending and taking more risk. "The wealth effect from surging stock prices is a powerful tailwind to consumer confidence, spending and broader economic growth," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. "Of course, this highlights a vulnerability of the economy if the stock market were to falter. This isn't the most likely scenario, but it is a scenario given that stocks appear richly (over) valued." Yet, the latest report also highlights how top-heavy stock ownership remains in the U.S. According to the Fed report, the top 10% of Americans own 87% of individually held stocks and mutual funds. The top 1% own half of all individually held stocks. Economists say a rising stock market brings outsized benefits to the wealthy, mainly boosting the high end of the consumer and spending markets. The wealth of middle-class and lower-income Americans depends more on wages and home values than stocks. "Those households in the top one-third of the income distribution and who own the bulk of the stock holdings account for approximately two-thirds of consumer spending," Zandi said. Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab , said stocks represent a growing share of the assets of the top 1%. Stocks accounted for 37.8% of the overall share of household assets for the top 1% at the end of 2023, up from a recent low of 36.5%. Yet because the wealthy don't need to spend as much of their gains – a phenomenon known as the marginal propensity to consume – Sonders said the added stock wealth for the 1% may not have a substantial impact on the consumer economy. She noted that consumer confidence among those making more than $125,000 a year has been in "secular decline" since 2017, according to the Conference Board. "While the bump in stock prices might link to stronger confidence, it doesn't necessarily point to stronger spending at the higher end," she said. With the S&P 500 already up 10% this year, it is likely that the wealth of the upper echelon has already topped the record at the end of 2023. While inequality declined slightly in 2021 and 2022, as wages increased and housing prices surged, the wealth gap has since crept back to pre-pandemic levels. The top 1% accounted for 30% of the nation's wealth at the end of the fourth quarter, while the top 10% accounted for 67% of all wealth.

Watch NBC6 free wherever you are WATCH HERE The wealth of the top 1% hit a record $44.6 trillion at the end of the fourth quarter, as an end-of-year stock rally lifted their portfolios, according to new data from the Federal Reserve. The total net worth of the top 1%, defined by the Fed as those with wealth over $11 million, increased by $2 trillion in the fourth quarter. All of the gains came from their stock holdings. The value of corporate equities and mutual fund shares held by the top 1% surged to $19.7 trillion from $17.65 trillion the previous quarter. While their real estate values went up slightly, the value of their privately held businesses declined, essentially canceling out all other gains outside of stocks. The quarterly gain marked the latest addition to an unprecedented wealth boom that began in 2020 with the Covid-19 pandemic market surge. Since 2020, the wealth of the top 1% has increased by nearly $15 trillion, or 49%. Middle-class Americans have also seen a rising wealth tide, with the middle 50% to 90% of Americans seeing their wealth increase 50%. Economists say the rising stock market is giving an added boost to consumer spending through what is known as the "wealth effect." When consumers and investors see their stock holdings soar, they feel more confident spending and taking more risk. "The wealth effect from surging stock prices is a powerful tailwind to consumer confidence, spending and broader economic growth," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. "Of course, this highlights a vulnerability of the economy if the stock market were to falter. This isn't the most likely scenario, but it is a scenario given that stocks appear richly (over) valued." Yet, the latest report also highlights how top-heavy stock ownership remains in the U.S. According to the Fed report, the top 10% of Americans own 87% of individually held stocks and mutual funds. The top 1% own half of all individually held stocks. Economists say a rising stock market brings outsized benefits to the wealthy, mainly boosting the high end of the consumer and spending markets. The wealth of middle-class and lower-income Americans depends more on wages and home values than stocks. "Those households in the top one-third of the income distribution and who own the bulk of the stock holdings account for approximately two-thirds of consumer spending," Zandi said. Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab , said stocks represent a growing share of the assets of the top 1%. Stocks accounted for 37.8% of the overall share of household assets for the top 1% at the end of 2023, up from a recent low of 36.5%. Yet because the wealthy don't need to spend as much of their gains – a phenomenon known as the marginal propensity to consume – Sonders said the added stock wealth for the 1% may not have a substantial impact on the consumer economy. She noted that consumer confidence among those making more than $125,000 a year has been in "secular decline" since 2017, according to the Conference Board. "While the bump in stock prices might link to stronger confidence, it doesn't necessarily point to stronger spending at the higher end," she said. With the S&P 500 already up 10% this year, it is likely that the wealth of the upper echelon has already topped the record at the end of 2023. While inequality declined slightly in 2021 and 2022, as wages increased and housing prices surged, the wealth gap has since crept back to pre-pandemic levels. The top 1% accounted for 30% of the nation's wealth at the end of the fourth quarter, while the top 10% accounted for 67% of all wealth.

Frederic J. Brown / AFP / Getty Close Welcome to Investopedia's economics live blog, where we'll explain what the day's news says about the state of the U.S. economy and how that's likely to affect your finances. Here we will compile data releases, economic reports, quotes from expert sources and anything else that helps explain economic issues and why they matter to you. Today, a measure of the economy's health was revised upward and pending home sales gave insight into whether the gridlock in the housing market is starting to clear. Catch the economics blog again on Monday, as we will take a break while the markets are closed on Friday. Mortgage Rates Dip, Sparking Hope Inventory is Sustainably Improving March 28, 2024 04:08 PM EDT Mortgage rates continued to move below the 7% level this week, a good sign that more homes could be for sale soon as rates could continue to move lower, according to Freddie Mac. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage declined to 6.79%, slipping from last week’s 6.87% . The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage was also lower, dropping to 6.11% this week. Since December, mortgage rates have see-sawed under 7%. “Rates remain elevated near 7% as markets watch for signs of cooling inflation, hoping that rates will come down further,” Khatner said. Freddie Mac Chief Economist Sam Khatner pointed to “encouraging” data showing existing home sales jumped in February. That was an improvement from last year when inventory problems stymied the home sales market as mortgage rates moved to decades-high levels . -Terry Lane Consumer Views on the Economy Are Stabilizing March 28, 2024 11:28 AM EDT In its final reading for March, consumer sentiment surged ahead of economists' projections but remained relatively steady throughout the first quarter of 2024. The Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index moved up to 79.4 in March, up from the prior reading of 76.9. However, that's within the margin of error, showing that opinions on the economy have been mostly locked in since January, said survey director Joanne Hsu. Consumer sentiment is nearly 30% higher than year-ago levels. “This stability reflects a perception among consumers that the economy has been holding steady in its current state,” Hsu said. Consumers also felt better about inflation, the survey showed. Their expectations for price increases moderated for both the year ahead and the long run. Consumer survey results on both current economic conditions and economic expectations improved. “Assessments and expectations of personal finances improved modestly from last month, as the perceived negative effects of high prices and expenses on living standards eased,” Hsu said. -Terry Lane Home Sale Contracts Ticked Up In February As Housing Market Thaw Continued March 28, 2024 10:11 AM EDT It’s not saying much, but 2024 is shaping up to be a better year for the housing market than 2023 was, according to new data on pending home sales. There were 1.6% more sales for existing homes in the pipeline in February than in January, based on contract signings that month, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. If that forward-looking indicator translates into actual home sales, it would continue this year’s trend of home sales bouncing back from the rock-bottom levels they hit in 2023. High mortgage rates, low for-sale inventories, and record prices combined to stifle homebuying last year to its slowest pace since 1995 . Two of those three factors have improved since late last year—the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has hovered in the high 6% range after nearing 8% late last fall, according to Freddie Mac. As a result, more homes have come on the market, the association said. The job market is still favorable to workers despite a recent slowdown, keeping some buyers in the market no matter how unaffordable it’s become . "While modest sales growth might not stir excitement, it shows slow and steady progress from the lows of late last year,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun in a press release. “Ongoing job gains are clearly increasing demand along with more inventory.” Despite the uptick, home sales still face massive headwinds—pending home sales were still down 7% compared to February 2023, the association said. Economy Grew Faster Than Thought In Fourth Quarter March 28, 2024 09:44 AM EDT Consumer spending is once again propelling the economy at a faster pace than initial estimates indicated. With all the data from the fourth quarter now in, it turns out the U.S. economy—as measured by inflation-adjusted Gross Domestic Product—grew at an annual rate of 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023, faster than the prior estimate of 3.2%, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Thursday in its third and final revision of the quarter’s data. The increase, due to upward revisions in estimates of consumer spending, beat forecasters’ expectations for 3.2% annual growth, according to a survey of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and the Wall Street Journal . Figures for nonresidential fixed investment—things like business equipment—also increased, offsetting a downward revision for how much businesses built up their inventories, trends that could set the stage for more growth down the road. “There is plenty to like in the upward revision to Q4 U.S. real GDP growth as stronger consumer spending and slower inventory build pave the way more favorably for growth early this year,” Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a commentary. The 3.4% annual growth rate was a slowdown from the blockbuster 4.9% growth of the third quarter but still underscored how consumer spending, the beating heart of the U.S. economy, has stayed solid despite punishingly high interest rates. Resilient consumer spending has helped stave off a long-predicted recession amid the Federal Reserve’s anti-inflation interest rate hikes, at least so far. The Fed’s efforts to cool inflation—and the economy—with the highest interest rates since 2001 haven’t slowed business down as much as many economists had initially feared. Inflation is still running above the central bank’s target of a 2% annual rate, and data including the GDP shows the economy running hotter than expected. Because of this, some economists are bracing for the war on inflation to drag on at least through the end of the year , with interest rates staying higher for longer. Initial Jobless Claims Fell Slightly Last Week March 28, 2024 09:12 AM EDT Fewer people filed for unemployment insurance in the week ending March 23 than they did the week before. Initial jobless claims were down 2,000 people from the revised numbers from the prior week to 210,000. The four-week average, which is less volatile than the weekly number, was down 750. These numbers still are historically low, indicating that the labor market remains strong in the face of high interest rates. "The Fed doesn't require significant weakening in the labor market to begin cutting interest rates but needs to be confident the job market is balanced enough to support a continued slowing in wage growth," wrote Oxford Eocnomics' Nancy Vanden Houten.

March 28 (UPI) -- The U.S. economy grew even more in the fourth quarter of 2023 than previously reported, according to a Bureau of Economic Analysis report released Thursday. U.S. Gross Domestic Product was revised up to an annual rate of 3.4%, while personal income increased by $230.2 billion in the fourth quarter, up $10.7 billion from the previous estimate. The increase in real GDP, adjusted for inflation, was 3.2%. "The update primarily reflected upward revisions to consumer spending and nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by a downward revision to private inventory investment," the Commerce Department's BEA said in a statement. Related Though U.S. economy shows signs of strength, poll shows third of Americans rate it as poor Joe Biden needs to make voters understand how to make this 'the best of times' U.S. economy added 275,000 jobs in February, unemployment was 3.9% Driving the revised real economic output were consumer spending increases, government spending, exports and fixed investments. Even the previous estimate of a 2.5% GDP rise before this upward revision beat economic expectations for the 2023 fourth quarter. Personal saving grew, too. It was up $6.3 billion to $815.5 billion. The saving rate climbed by one percent to 4.0%. On top of the personal income and savings gains, domestic U.S. corporate profits increased by $5.9 billion, compared with a $9 billion rise in profits for the third quarter of 2023. For 2023 as a whole, the BEA said, real gross output increased 2.1%, private goods-producing industries increased 2 % , private services-producing industries increased 2.1%, and government increased 2.2%. "Overall, 17 of 22 industry groups contributed to the increase in real gross output," it said. As for prices, the BEA said the price index for gross domestic purchases was up 1.9% in the fourth quarter while PCE, the personal consumption expenditures, increased 1.8%. The PCE index excluding food and energy increased 2.0%.

Δ But the latest — and revised — data on gross domestic product released Thursday (March 28) by the Bureau of Economic Analysis details the fourth quarter and gives some hints as to what may come in the months ahead. The headline numbers show that real GDP was 3.4% higher in the fourth quarter, an upward revision of 0.2% from the earlier estimate for the period. The new revision still notches a marked slowdown from the 4.9% growth rate that had been seen in the third quarter. The bureau said in its Thursday release that the upward revision was tied to increases in consumer spending and private investment, as supplemental materials revealed that real final sales in the quarter were 3.3% higher, up 0.4% from the earlier estimates. The price index was 1.9% higher, unchanged from earlier data, and the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index was also unchanged, with 1.8% growth. Real consumer spending was 0.2% higher than consensus expectations for the quarter, indicating that the U.S. household is resilient — at least when it comes to forking over money at the register. Disposable Income Revised “Disposable personal income increased $190.4 billion, or 3.8%, in the fourth quarter, a downward revision of $12.1 billion from the previous estimate,” the bureau said. “Real disposable personal income increased 2%, a downward revision of 0.2%.” Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Real disposable income is adjusted for inflation and indicates what consumers have left in the tank, so to speak, to keep spending, to invest or to save. We’re already nearly at the end of the first quarter, and we’ll get fresh data for February on Friday (March 29) about core PCE and personal spending. Each data point, month by month, quarter by quarter, winds up telling a story. The deceleration in the economy bears watching, even if the fourth quarter got a slight bump. At the household/consumer level, real disposable income may be growing, but the pace is lumpy. What Comes Next? The impact may be measured in the present-day intent to spend, especially against the backdrop where, as PYMNTS Intelligence reported late last year, consumer debt is three times “more” than disposable income. Separate data on consumer sentiment noted that the Expectations Index — which The Conference Board said is based on consumers’ short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions —fell to 73.8 from the February number of 76.3. “An Expectations Index reading below 80 often signals a forthcoming recession,” the board added. The board also gave assessments of consumers’ spending outlook. In 16 separate categories — spanning from motor vehicles to pet care to travel — only a minority of respondents said they would look to spend over the near term. Many said they would spend the same amount through the next six months. As many as 30% of consumers said they anticipated spending less over the next six months on travel. Nearly 18% said the same for spending on beauty and personal care items and services. A full 26.2% said they would spend less at restaurants.

The U.S. economy ended last year growing at an even stronger pace than previously thought, data from the government showed Thursday. Gross domestic product, the official scorecard of the economy, grew at a 3.4 percent annualized rate in the final three months of 2023. The previous estimate had the economy growing at a 3.2 percent pace. The figures are adjusted for inflation. Consumer spending rose at a 3.3 percent annualized rate, much faster than the 3.0 percent rate estimated a month a ago. Estimates of economic growth get revised as the government collects more data about output, consumption, and investment. The last update, the third since the end of the quarter, reflects an upward revisions to consumer spending and nonresidential fixed investment. Business investment in inventories was revised down, partly offsetting the upward pressure on GDP. Inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index, rose at a 1.8 percent pace, matching the previous estimate. Core PCE inflation, which excludes food and fuel prices, rose at a 2.0 percent pace, a downward revision from the previous estimate of 2.1 percent. Gross domestic income, an alternative measure of economic activity, rose at a 4.8 percent pace. This is the first estimate of GDI. Some economists average GDP and GDI as a way of approximating economic growth. The average in the fourth quarter was 4.1 percent. GDP grew by 2.5 percent in 2023, compared with an increase of 1.9 percent in 2022. The increase was driven by faster growth in consumer spending, nonresidential fixed investment, state and local government spending, exports, and federal government spending.

By Indrabati Lahiri Published on 28/03/2024 - 14:56 GMT+1 Share Comments Share Facebook Twitter Flipboard Send Reddit Linkedin Messenger Telegram VK Bluesky Threads Whatsapp The UK slid into a technical recession at the end of 2023 because of increased inflation and soaring interest rates. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s attempts to convince consumers that the country’s economy is recovering are on thin ice. The UK officially entered a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth, at the end of last year, due to higher inflation, reduced external demand and record interest rates. The economic slump has prompted swathes of criticism from opposition politicians, notably Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who said that Sunak “has broken his promise to grow the economy and left Britain in recession with working people paying the price,” according to Yahoo Finance. “The Conservatives cannot claim that their plan is working or that they have turned the corner on more than 14 years of economic failure,” she said. Ahead of the general election, the prime minister has been trying to reassure consumers and Tory MPs alike that the economy is recovering, mainly based on private sector activity bouncing back lately. This technical recession is the first one since the first half of 2020, when the UK economy was still reeling under the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic. Related Member states invest in new euro coins to celebrate special events Michelle Yeoh to join business and political leaders at Global Citizen NOW summit to fight poverty The final estimate for the quarter-on-quarter GDP report for the last quarter of 2023 was released on Thursday, clocking in at -0.3%, according to the Office for National Statistics. This was in line with analyst forecasts, although a step down from the last quarter’s -0.1%. Falling exports were one of the key reasons for this dampened number, as well as changes in inventory. Household consumption also fell somewhat by 0.1%, versus -0.9% in the previous quarter. This was largely due to decreased spending on household goods and services, culture and recreation and footwear and clothing. However, fixed investment increased by 0.9%, stabilising after two quarters of reduction, mainly due to investments in transport and buildings. Government consumption also inched up 0.1% for the third quarter in a row, mainly because of increased defence and public administration spending. The year-on-year GDP report for Q4 2023 came in at -0.2%, in line with analyst expectations, but down from the last quarter’s 0.2%. US economy expands more than expected in Q4 2023 Things may appear brighter across the pond. In the US, the final estimate for the quarter-on-quarter GDP for Q4 2023 clocked in at 3.4%, which was more than analyst expectations of 3.2%, according to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. However, it was also a sharp reduction from the previous quarter’s 4.9%. This was mainly due to consumer spending increasing by 3.3%, from 3% in the second estimate. Consumer spending on goods inched up less than the previous estimate, at 3%, down from 3.2%. However, consumer spending on services was revised upwards to 3.4% from 2.8% in the previous estimate. Non-residential investment also rose to 3.7% from 2.4%, however, residential investment fell to 2.8% from 2.9% in the second estimate. Coming to the full year 2023, the US economy advanced by 2.5% from 1.9% in the previous year.

QUOTE OF THE DAY 'No one should have to work longer than they want to. But I do think it's a bit crazy that our anchor idea for the right retirement age â€” 65 years old â€” originates from the time of the Ottoman Empire.'Â BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in his annual shareholder letter, which focused mainly on the U.S.'s retirement crisis due to longer life expectancies. His suggestions for a solution included encouraging Americans to work longer before retiring. In The Spotlight What does 'Quiet on the Set' mean for kids' TV? "Quiet on the Set" is raising quite a ruckus. The four-part documentary goes behind the scenes of Nickelodeon's popular turn-of-the-millennium shows to depict a "volatile, dysfunctional and sometimes sexualized environment" for child actors, said The Washington Post. "There's a dark underbelly to child stardom," said Bryan Hearne, who was an actor on "All That." The documentary focuses on Dan Schneider, the "golden boy" creator of many Nickelodeon shows who left under a cloud of scandal in 2018. Interviewees "recounted tales of alleged racism, sexism, harassment and verbal abuse at his hands," USA Today said. Schneider expressed remorse in an interview posted to his YouTube page. "I definitely owe some people a pretty strong apology," he said.Â "Apologies aren't enough," said The Guardian. The actors traumatized by their time on Nickelodeon shows are "seeking change and accountability in an industry that turned a blind eye to predatory behavior." Will the shocking revelations produce change?Â The latest "More protections are now in place" since Schneider's ouster, The Wrap said, but industry experts say "there's still more to be done." Background checks are now mandatory, and parents or guardians must be in sight of child actors at all times. However, too many people fear being blackballed by the industry.Â One former star â€” Drake Bell, of "Drake & Josh" â€” was sexually abused by a dialogue coach. Nickelodeon said it is committed to "fostering a safe and professional workplace environment." But the response feels "pretty empty," because "they still show our shows," Bell said during a podcast interview. "And I have to pay for my own therapy." The reaction Nickelodeon's "nebulous" response to the documentary does "little to assure audiences that there's been any notable transformation" in working conditions for child actors, Lorraine Ali said at the Los Angeles Times. The "weak-sauce defenses" demonstrate that the "hushing effect of power and the quiet acceptance of predatory behavior is still an evergreen in Hollywood." Â "The current safeguards for child safety and well-being in the studio environment are clearly insufficient," Kelly Lawler said at USA Today. The former child actors in the documentary "urge more regulation, tougher laws and other safeguards." But many say they would never let their own children act. Profits, after all, too often come before safety in Hollywood. "Will the documentary change anything? It's hard to be optimistic." Statistic of the day 10,000: The number of families that will live in Egypt's uncompleted New Administrative Capital, by the end of 2024, according to the head of the city's project, Khaled Abbas. In addition, 48,000 government employees already work in the developing capital, which is expected to enter its second phase of construction later this year.Â CNN the explainer Citizen science says anyone can be a scientist You can be a scientist! Or at least you can play a crucial part in up-and-coming scientific research. Because citizen science is becoming increasingly accepted by researchers as a way to gather data.Â What is citizen science? Citizen science is a "field of research in which members of the general public participate in scientific projects, often in collaboration with professional scientists," Three O'Clock said. Citizen science has become an "increasingly acknowledged approach applied in many scientific domains" and particularly within the environmental and ecological sciences," said a 2022 study published in the journal Nature Reviews Methods Primers. Researchers often create citizen science groups to aid in monitoring and data collection without requiring extra funding. For example, bird-watchers can be considered citizen scientists as they help track species and add to existing databases.Â Benefits The largest benefit is the power in numbers. "Data collection isn't just for researchers," said Popular Science. Climate and environmental science can particularly benefit from citizen science.Â "For issues that affect huge swathes of areas like pollution or radiation, which can only be properly measured at scale, that kind of mass data collection can be vital," said Wired. "Publicly available data gathered by citizens removes the chance of any middleman who may be unable, because of underfunding or political crisis, to gather enough data." Pieter Franken, the co-founder of the nonprofit Safecast dedicated to citizen science, said to Wired, "Citizen science doesn't just let people collect data, it empowers them and gives them a voice." Drawbacks Critics of citizen science argue that "untrained citizens could collect shoddy or even biased data that won't have scientific rigor or reliability," Wired said. "Designing and implementing citizen science projects require a unique set of skills and knowledge outside the research itself," the Nature Reviews Methods Primers study said. Without proper oversight and organization, the data collected may not be reliable. Citizen science could also highlight societal inequality. "Citizen science may engage only certain parts of society, which may potentially fail to include historically underrepresented groups," said the study. "This raises concerns about the relevance of citizen science to diverse communities." Poll watch Fewer than 4 in 10 Americans are willing to pay for surge pricing â€” paying more for goods during peak times of demand â€” according to a new Ipsos poll. The poll surveyed 1,120 adults and found that 35% were willing to pay surge pricing for food, while 33% were willing to pay surge pricing for concert tickets and transportation services.Â Good day Â âš–ï¸ â€¦ forÂ WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. He dodged the threat of immediate extradition to the U.S., where he faces espionage charges after London's High Court delayed a ruling on his lawyer's request to grant another appeal. The court gave the U.S. government three weeks to send assurances that Assange would have a fair trial and not get the death penalty if convicted. Bad day Â ? â€¦ for Â GameStop employees. The video game retailer said it cut an unspecified number of jobs to reduce costs after a dip in fourth-quarter revenue "amid rising competition from e-commerce firms and weak consumer spending in an uncertain economy," said Reuters. The company's fourth-quarter revenue of $1.79 billion was lower than the $2.23 billion made last year as it "grappled with stiff competition" from Amazon and eBay. WORD OF THE DAY psychodrama A therapeutic technique where clients use dramatization and role play to explore issues in their lives. A scathing report from The New Yorker on the state of U.K. politics after 14 years of Conservative Party rule used the term to describe how leaders have been "climbing and chucking one another off the ladder of British public life" over the past decade and a half. INSTANT OPINION Today's best commentary 'Biden's EV mandate is an affront to car lovers' Charles C.W. Cooke at National Review There are many reasons to be outraged over the Biden administration's "ongoing attempt to coerce us into electric vehicles over the next decade," says Charles C.W. Cooke. "I object to the federal government presuming that its role in our lives includes telling us what we may drive." Also, "I like cars." I want a gas-powered car, not a "glorified golf cart," and "you'll take my ability to buy them at will from my cold oil-stained hands." 'RFK Jr.'s running mate is young and very rich.

Democrats fear Shanahan's money could get Kennedy on enough swing-state ballots to "return Trump to the White House." 'Why Netanyahu is deliberately alienating his strongest allies' Fred Kaplan at Slate Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to Washington's decision not to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a Gaza cease-fire and the release of Hamas hostages by dissing President Joe Biden as "few U.S. allies had ever done before," says Fred Kaplan. He canceled a Washington trip for advisers to discuss "less destructive" ways to "eradicate" Hamas, pushing U.S.-Israel relations to an "all-time low" to please "far-right" domestic allies he needs for "political survival."

Title: Mexico Wants More Rewards for Guarding Joe Biden Border in 2024 Election

Article Content:
The flow of migrants at the border rose by 15 percent in February after President Joe Biden outsourced U.S. border security to Mexico’s pro-migration president. Biden’s border agents registered 142,000 illegal migrants in February, up from 125,000 in January. That border inflow was in addition to the invited inflow of 114,000 economic migrants through several quasi-legal doorways announced by Biden’s deputies. That 15 percent jump in illegals is not what Biden’s deputies wanted when they asked Mexico in December to slash the northward flow of illegals during the 2024 election year. Officer Catches, Arrests Colorado Driver for Human Smuggling Video Source: Texas Department of Public Safety They asked “for us to try and contain the flow of migration,” Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, told the 60 Minutes TV show in a March 24 broadcast . But “the flow of migrants will continue” if Biden does not cooperate with Mexico’s ambitions, Obrador told 60 Minutes . “AMLO knows he has Biden over a barrel,” said a tweet from Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies. AMLO has Biden over a barrel because Biden fears he will lose left-wing voters — and wealthy donors — if he tries to enforce Americans’ border laws, but will lose even more centrist votes if Obarador allows more migrants over the border. The tempting fix for Biden is to let Obrador’s police guard the U.S. border by arresting and clubbing migrants as they head north through Mexico. In December, Biden’s border deputies agreed to Obrador’s deal — and Mexico began arresting more migrants in January. During December, Obrador let a record-breaking flood of 251,000 illegal migrants cross the U.S. border far from the official border gates. Once the December deal was signed, Obrador suddenly slashed the illegal January inflow by 50 percent. “We were more careful about our southern border,” Obrador told 60 Minutes , adding: We spoke with the presidents of Central America, with the president of Venezuela, and with the president of Cuba. We asked them for help in curbing the flow of migrants. However, that is a short-term solution, not a long term. The sudden Mexican policy shift reveals what has been obvious for decades: The flow of illegal migrants across the U.S. border is protected and concealed by both the U.S. and the Mexican governments. The hidden government approval means the illegal inflow is better described as a government-run, cartel-taxed, off-the-books, unofficial economic and migration policy that works alongside the legal immigration system. The resulting huge inflow of illegal migrant workers, consumers, and renters is mostly used as an economic stimulant for Wall Street’s consumer-economy investments, regardless of the massive harm inflicted on ordinary Americans. Many Wall Street leaders — and many politicians — asked for the consumer-economy inflow in 1990 just as they were outsourcing much of the Midwest’s manufacturing and consumer economies to Asia and Mexico. Everybody Scatter! Illegals Bail as Officers Catch Human Smuggler Who Admits to Trafficking Operation Video Source: Texas Department of Public Safety Since 2021, Biden has invited at least 7 million more migrants to pass through the official border gates, often under the claim of having created new “legal pathways.” That quasi-legal inflow of migrants dropped slightly in February, down to 114,000. But Mexico gets a lot from the unofficial migration system. For example, it has moved perhaps 15 million Mexicans into the United States, giving it a growing — but limited — political influence, plus a huge flood of valuable remittances. Biden has made the deal sweeter for Mexico as he relies on Mexico to help bring more global migrants across the southern border. For example, Biden and his deputies rarely comment on Mexico’s massive exports of fentanyl drugs into the United States, despite the huge death toll of roughly 70,000 young Americans each year. “Mexico First — our home comes first,” Obrador said at his March 22 news briefing: We are not going to act as policemen for any foreign government … Of course, we are going to cooperate in fighting drugs, above all because it has become a very sensitive, very sad humanitarian issue, because a lot of young people are dying in the United States because of fentanyl. “The drug cartels provide jobs in regions where the Mexican government can’t provide economic development, they encourage social mobility, and generate revenue through drug sales to balance trade and investment deficits.”David Saucedo, a security analyst, told the Associated Press. Similarly, U.S. government data shows that since April 2023, Biden’s deputies have given migration papers to roughly 15,000 Mexicans a month . But those concessions are not enough for Obrador. He is a Latino nationalist, he favors more Latino migration into the United States, and he wants to create a coalition of Latino states against the United States. Deliberately or not, Obrador let the January inflow rise by 15 percent during February, so reminding Biden that he has the power to damage vulnerable Biden during the 2024 election season. Biden’s staff was silent about the greater inflow — but House Speaker Mike Johnson blasted both Obrador and Biden: “The Marxist President of Mexico blackmails America,” said a tweet from Steve Cortes , a former spokesman for Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis. He added: AMLO wants Americans to give $20 billion a year to Latin America PLUS give amnesty to millions of illegal aliens from Mexico who are living in America. Zero respect for the US! When asked by 60 Minutes, if Mexico will continue to curb the migration, AMLO replied, “We do and we want to continue doing it.” 60 Minutes described his price: Obrador proposed his fix: that the United States commit $20 billion a year to four countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, lift, sanctions on Venezuela and the Cuban embargo, and legalize [amnesty] millions of law-abiding Mexicans living in the US. “I’m speaking frankly,” Obrador told 60 Minutes . “We have to say things as they are, and I always say what I feel. I always say what I think.” Editor’s note : This article has been updated.

Hot Stocks: The 3 Best Opportunities for Investing in REITs InvestorPlace Mar. 24, 2024, 02:59 PM InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Not too long ago, I came across an article about commercial property opportunities and my mind immediately went to REIT stocks or securities tied to real estate investment trusts. It wasn’t so much about the story but the public comments that made the content memorable. Apparently, experts in the field believe that there’s a massive bargain offered right now in commercial real estate. That makes sense because of the residual impact of the Covid-19 crisis. However, internet commenters balked at the price necessary to participate in the deals, which numbered well into the millions. That’s not exactly an amount the average retail investor throws around casually. So yes, there might be viable prospects in commercial real estate but you might not be able to access them. But don’t fret – that’s where these REIT stocks may save the day. EPR Properties (EPR) Source: Shutterstock Based in Kansas City, Missouri, EPR Properties (NYSE: EPR ) represents the leading diversified experiential net lease REIT. Per its public profile , the company specializes in select enduring experiential properties in the commercial property industry. It focuses on venues that create value by facilitating out-of-home leisure and recreation experiences. Since the start of the year, EPR stock incurred a loss of 14%. Granted, that’s not the start that management was looking for. Fundamentally, there are some extenuating circumstances. With the consumer economy suffering multiple headwinds of high inflation, high borrowing costs and tech-sector layoffs, many folks have decided to trim their spending. At the same time, consumers may also be prioritizing experiences and that bodes well for EPR stock. To be fair, for 2024, analysts are forecasting a down year, projecting earnings per share of $2.62 on sales of $617.76 million. Last year, the company posted EPS of $1.97 on sales of $705.67 million. However, the high-side revenue estimate calls for $717 million, which may be more realistic based on travel-related consumer sentiment. Thus, it’s one of the REIT stocks to consider. Welltower (WELL) Source: Shutterstock Headquartered in Toledo, Ohio, Welltower (NYSE: WELL ) in many ways sells itself. According to its corporate profile , the REIT invests with leading senior housing operators, post-acute providers, and health systems to fund the real estate and infrastructure needed to scale innovative care delivery models and improve people’s wellness and overall health care experience. Since the start of the year, WELL gained over 3% of its market value. Fundamentally, senior care service providers are attractive because of demographic realities. Millions of baby boomers will be retiring and many will require care. Yes, it’s true that last fiscal year, Welltower’s earnings performances were shaky. Overall, the average surprise came out to 12.33% below parity. There were some good quarters and some really bad ones. However, for 2024, experts project that EPS will land at $1.27 on sales of $7.46 billion. That’s very favorable to 2023’s print of profits of 66 cents per share on sales of $6.64 billion. Also, the REIT pays a forward dividend yield of 2.62%. Covering experts peg shares a moderate buy with a $99.21 average price target. Realty Income (O) Source: Shutterstock Probably the most famous of REIT stocks, Realty Income (NYSE: O ) is arguably best known for providing a monthly dividend. It’s also a sizable one at a forward yield of 5.88%. Yes, the payout ratio is elevated but here’s the thing about REIT stocks. Generally, these entities run a higher ratio than non-REITs based on their distinct business structure. Fundamentally, what’s really appealing about Realty is the core underlying industry. The company benefits from cash flows from over 15,450 real estate properties. This massive footprint encompasses businesses of all stripes, particularly brands that you shop at every day. Unless you envision a world where people no longer need home-improvement products, for instance, Realty should be a solid idea. Okay, Realty may have incurred a mixed performance in fiscal 2023. However, analysts are looking for a rebound in 2024, projecting EPS of $1.41 on sales of $4.87 billion. That’s much better than last year’s EPS of $1.26 on sales of $4.08 billion. Finally, O stock carries a moderate buy view with a $60.38 price target. It’s easily one of the REIT stocks to buy.

Title: Secret Report : Trudeau High - Migration Canada Slides Toward Poverty and Chaos

Article Content:
A government report in Canada forecasted a deep civic breakdown in the once-stable society that now suffers from unprecedented levels of elite-imposed migration. The secret and heavily redacted report was prepared by the country’s version of the FBI — the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The partial copy was extracted from the agency by an academic lawyer and was published in Canada’s National Post newspaper. The report is titled “Whole-of-Government Five-Year Trends for Canada,” and features many progressive-approved concerns about claimed global warming in cold-weather Canada. But the visible sections of the text spotlight several obvious costs of migration — expensive housing, wider wealth gaps, and reduced civic trust caused by the government’s policy of forced diversity: Popular Resentment The coming period of recession will also accelerate the decline in living standards that the younger generations have already witnessed compared to earlier generations. For example, many Canadians under 35 are unlikely ever to be able to buy a place to live. The fallout from this decline in living standards will be exacerbated by the fact that the difference between the extremes of wealth is greater now in developed countries than it has been in any time in several generations. Erosion of Trust The past seven years have seen more social and political polarization in the Western World … Paranoid Populism Capitalizing on the rise of political polarization and conspiracy theories have been populists willing to tailor their messages to appeal to extremist movements. Authoritarian movements have been on the rise in many liberal-democratic nations … “The situation will probably deteriorate further in the next five years,” the report begins. The report repeatedly suggests that Donald Trump’s pro-citizen populism is a danger to Canada’s elite and that Canada’s police forces be beefed up. But it does not mention the likely cause of Canada’s crash — the elite-imposed and revolutionary policy of mass migration, which is rapidly creating civic conflict while also reducing average income, productivity , and birth rates. The vast migration is pushed by Canada’s unpopular prime minister, Justin Trudeau, at the request of business groups. His progressive government is importing roughly 1 million people per year — or roughly three migrants for every Canadian birth. That massive inflow is roughly twice the per-person inflow engineered by President Joe Biden and his pro-migration deputies. The policy is boosting the country’s stock market as it suppressing wages , spiking inflation, making homes unaffordable , deterring marriages and births , creating homeless encampments , and spiking civil strife among Canadians who are losing their livelihood, dreams, political clout, and national culture. For example, Canada’s productivity has been declining because Trudeau’s migration allows investors to profit from the consumer economy created by the inflow of poor and uneducated foreign workers , consumers, and renters. However, this growth-by-poverty strategy reduces pressure on investors to focus on the growth-by-productivity strategy that raises wages and wealth through greater use of technology, training, innovation, and trade. The inflow is also importing old ethnic conflicts into what was once a stable, prosperous, and high-trust nation. The resulting chaos helps politicians divorce themselves from the needs of ordinary Canadians, and it divides public opposition amid the government’s policy of high migration and low productivity. The policy is so destructive that top economists are spotlighting the damage to Canada’s productivity and technology . “Lower productivity almost always means lower living standards,” Trevor Tombe, a Canadian economist wrote in 2023: According to the latest data from Statistics Canada, which was released last week, Canada’s labour productivity—that is, how much stuff each hour of work produces on average— fell for the fourth consecutive quarter. As a result, Canadian productivity is now about 2 percent lower at the beginning of 2023 than it was one year earlier. Worse, this has reversed several years of gains. We’re now back to mid-2017 levels. This matters. Had productivity growth in Canada kept pace with the United States over the past five years, I estimate we’d be producing over 8 percent more per hour worked than we do now. That’s enormous. Roughly speaking, it’s equivalent to $5,500 per person in lost economic output. Given how closely wages are tied to productivity, this directly affects our living standards and, in my view, poses a bigger affordability challenge than recent high inflation. … Most Canadian provinces lag far behind almost all U.S. states. Ontario, for example, has a per-person level of economic output that is similar to Alabama (both equivalent to $55,000 USD worth of final goods and services produced annually per person). The Maritimes are below Mississippi, and Quebec and Manitoba lag behind West Virginia. Only Alberta exceeds the U.S. average of $76,000, but even Canada’s strongest economy ranks 14th overall. It’s roughly comparable to New Jersey and Texas, but 13 percent below California and nearly one-quarter below New York. On March 21, Trudeau’s government announced it would trim his catastrophic immigration policy. “We need to ensure the number of temporary residents entering the country is at a sustainable level,” immigration minister Marc Miller told reporters. The government wants to trim the number of so-called “temporary residents” from 6.5 percent down to 5 percent of the population by 2026, according to a Reuters report . “This will help strengthen the alignment between immigration planning, community capacity, and labor market needs and support predictable population growth,” he claimed. Currently, Trudeau’s poll ratings are in the toilet, having fallen from 28 percent in January 2022 to just 21 percent in March 2024. The rival “Progressive Conservative Party of Canada” now stands at 36 percent — even though it also supports more migration — while the pro-Canadian People’s Party of Canada is stuck at 3 percent.

20 March, 2024 Share this: facebook twitter email print Lesotho, Maseru, 20 March 2024 - The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, Sub Regional Office for Southern Africa (ECA SRO SA) provided technical support to the Government of Lesotho to develop the country’s successor national industrial policy through the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Business Development (MTIBD). The policy document aims to harness an export driven economic growth trajectory through industrialization, and was validated through a one-day workshop jointly organized by MTIBD and ECA SRO SA. The objective of the workshop was to review and identify gaps in the policy document, obtain feedback from participants and further, provide a platform for stakeholders who were unable to participate in the questionnaire-based data collection process to provide inputs into the draft policy document to enhance collective ownership of the Lesotho National Industrial Policy. In his opening remarks, Mr Thabo Moleko, Principal Secretary of MTIBD said that one of the key priority areas of the Successor Lesotho National Industrial Policy was enhancing inclusive Sustainable economic growth and private sector led job creation. He stated that the National Industrial Policy will among other things take into consideration the changes in the continental operating environment, including the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and ensure alignment with regional frameworks like the Southern Africa Development Community Industrialization Strategy and Roadmap (2015 – 2063), as a regional industrial development blueprint which aims to promote industrialization and deepen economic growth through structural transformation. He applauded ECA’s technical support to review the 2015-2017 Industrial Policy as a way of enhancing the efforts of government in improving the business and investment environment of the country and noted that, “I believe that together we can make Lesotho a responsive and attractive destination for domestic, regional and international investment in order to promote industrialization, enhance competitiveness leading to increased quality manufactured goods and exports”. ECA Sub regional Office for Southern Africa was represented by Ms. Olayinka Bandele, Chief, Inclusive Industrialization Section who reiterated the support of the United Nations to the Industrialization development agenda in the Kingdom of Lesotho in support of Sustainable Development Goals, specifically Goal 9 on Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure. She underscored three critical steps that the country must take: • Firstly, a shift from a consumer-based economy to a producer and export-driven economy as the consumer-based economy makes the Lesotho economy vulnerable to price volatilities and external shocks. •Secondly, the role of technological advancements and innovation in industrial development, as this will spur productivity gains and global competitiveness. •Lastly but not the least, the critical role of the private sector with Micro Small and Medium Enterprises at the center of the economy. The official speeches were followed by the presentation of the draft 2024-2028 National Industrial Policy by ECA SRO-SA consultant Dr. Mamello Nchake who guided group discussions on industrial policy priority areas, implementation arrangements, resource mobilization and monitoring and evaluation. She highlighted that one of the Strategic Policy Objectives was to accelerate economic diversification in industrial base as well as enhance energy efficiency and sustainability. The afternoon was dedicated to group discussions on the above thematic areas. The workshop was attended by participants from government ministries, the private sector, development partners, academic and research organizations, and local media houses. The session was closed by Ms. Mart Motebang, Director of Trade on behalf of the Ministry of Trade. She spoke to the government’s commitment to accelerate the implementation process once the industrial policy has been launched. She called on participating stakeholders to play an active role, “ each one of us has a role to play, please go back and interrogate the industrial policy so that key contributions are given to change the narrative so that the successor national industrial policy strengthens Lesotho’s capacity to coordinate industrial policy implementation, mobilize resources for implementation and monitoring progress to deliver on the country’s industrialization milestones.” The meeting ended with a stated ambition to deliver a finalized document as soon as possible in readiness for consideration by the government of Lesotho and thereafter implementation Issued by: Communications Section Economic Commission for Africa PO Box 3001 Addis Ababa Ethiopia Tel: +251 11 551 5826 E-mail: eca-info@un.org

Investor Ben Ashkenazy has a history of sparking debate. Now, he’ll be on stage for an exclusive discussion with Mickey Drexler , a retail pioneer who brought Gap around the country and current chairman of fashion start-up Alex Mill, at The Real Deal NYC Real Estate Forum . Five years ago, people said retail was dead. Today, investors have spent billions buying retail properties, renovating and improving existing places, and building spectacular new projects on Fifth Avenue and beyond. Vornado’s Steve Roth even told investors that “the retail apocalypse is passing ” in their last earnings call, and said that he is “convinced that rents are going to rise.” SIGN UP But not everyone survived the storm. And as retail revitalizes, it will look dramatically different than it has in the past. At The Real Deal Real Estate Forum, TRD is bringing together major investor Ashkenazy alongside retailer genius Drexler – who shepherded Apple through the opening of its first retail branches – to give industry insiders unprecedented insights into the future of this market as it rises from the ashes. This conversation will be a rare opportunity to hear firsthand from press-shy Ashkenazy, owner of some of the most iconic retail from coast to coast, as he shares his thoughts about luxury and major retail’s comeback in NYC. Drexler meanwhile was a driving force behind both Gap’s and J. Crew’s meteoric rises in the 1990s and aughts, as well as the brain behind Apple’s retail store concept. He will offer his perspective on what defines a successful retail brand, and what the best days of NYC retail can teach us about new opportunities ahead. Sign up today for The Real Deal NYC Real Estate Forum on May 8 at the Metropolitan Pavilion to get access to this discussion and all panel sessions, along with the Expo Floor and networking with 3,000 NYC professionals.

The largest US retail trade group is forecasting that the country’s retail sales will increase anywhere between 2.5% and 3.5% this year, a solid but still slower pace than the 3.6% seen last year. The National Retail Federation said Wednesday that it expects retail sales will reach between $5.23 trillion and $5.28 trillion this year. The 2024 forecast is roughly in line with the 10-year pre-pandemic average annual sales growth of 3.6%. “The economy is primarily supported by consumers who have shown much greater resilience than expected, and it’s hard to be bearish on the consumer,” the federation’s chief economist, Jack Kleinhenz, said. “The question for 2024 ultimately is, will consumer spending maintain its resilience?” The National Retail Federation said Wednesday that it expects retail sales will reach between $5.23 trillion and $5.28 trillion this year. AP A strong jobs market and rising wages have fueled household spending, but retail sales have become choppy in the face of rising credit costs and still higher prices . And shoppers have been shifting their spending to services after focusing on buying goods while they were staying close to home during the heart of the pandemic. The retail group’s forecast comes as Americans picked up their spending a bit in February after pulling back the previous month, according to the latest Commerce Department report. But last month’s gain of 0.6% was weaker than expected, and January’s decline was revised even lower, suggesting that many are growing more cautious with their money. The group’s calculation of retail sales excludes automobile dealers, gasoline stations and restaurants to focus on the core retail sector. The 2024 retail sales forecast is based on economic modeling that considers a variety of indicators including employment, wages, consumer confidence, disposable income, consumer credit, previous retail sales and weather.

Leadership Careers How Immigrants Are Boosting U.S. Economic And Job Growth By Jack Kelly , Former Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Jack Kelly covers career growth, job market and workplace trends. Mar 20, 2024, 03:30pm EDT Share Save Comment Immigration is fueling business and job creation in the U.S. According to MIT research, immigrants are 80% more likely to start a business than native-born U.S. citizens. getty Americans are becoming increasingly more concerned about border enforcement in the United States, with nearly half considering it a “ crisis ,” according to a poll by CBS News. Thirty percent of Americans view the border situation as “very serious.” However, according to economic research, immigration has been a net positive to the U.S. economy, driving job growth and increasing consumer spending. What Economists Are Saying In 2023, “foreign-born” workers comprised nearly 19% of the U.S. labor force, according to analysis by nonpartisan think tank Economic Policy Institute of Current Population Survey data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This is an uptick from 15.3% in 2006 . “The unexpectedly high level of immigration also explains some of the surprising strength in consumer spending and overall economic growth since 2022,” wrote economists Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson for the Hamilton Project, an economic policy initiative within the Brookings Institution. “Moreover, we expect immigration flows to further boost economic growth in 2024.” Immigrants have contributed largely to consumer spending growth by about 0.2 percentage point last year, with a similar boost expected this year, along with an increase in gross domestic product—a measure of all the goods and services produced—by 0.1 percentage point per year since 2022, Edelberg and Watson reported. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor The U.S. needs more workers to keep the economy humming. In the absence of foreign-born labor, the U.S. talent pool will continue to decline because of lower birth rates with an accompanying aging workforce of Baby Boomers looking to retire. From 2024 through 2027, 4.1 million Americans will reach the age of 65 each year, estimates the Income Institute at the Alliance for Lifetime Income. The current trends will make it hard to finance social programs such as Social Security. Federal Reserve Bank chair Jerome Powell said to the House Financial Services Committee earlier this month about the flow of immigration’s impact on the U.S. economy , “It's just arithmetic. If you add a couple million people to an economy, a percentage of them work, there will be more output." Powell added, “I'm not going to say anything is needed for the future or good policy indirectly or directly. I think it's just reporting the facts to say that immigration and labor force participation both contributed to the very strong economic output growth that we had last year.” Immigration is fueling business and job creation in the U.S. According to MIT research, immigrants are 80% more likely to start a business than native-born U.S. citizens. They are also responsible for 42% more job creation than native-born founders. A 2022 study by the National Foundation for American Policy revealed that 55% of U.S. billion-dollar startups , also referred to as “unicorn” companies, were founded by immigrants. The Challenges Faced Foreign-born workers in the U.S. are not immune to labor challenges. Rebecca Dixon, president and CEO of the National Employment Law Project, said about mass immigration in a press release , “One of the most crucial forces driving the nation’s job growth and economic vitality over the last year has been immigration.” She added that immigrant workers are at the “center of a growing crisis of workplace abuse, with undocumented and temporary visa migrant workers among the most vulnerable to abuses, including wage theft, health and safety risks, child labor violations and retaliation from employers.” Proponents of stronger border enforcement say immigration causes issues of overcrowding, congestion and extra pressure on public services, as well as downward pressure on wages for working-class families that are already having a tough time in a high-cost and inflationary environment.

ETMarkets.com "In the largecap space, these three – PSUs, large private sector banks and automobile companies – can do well." Nilesh Shah , MD & CEO, Envision Capital , says “manufacturing is becoming meaningful and the low hanging fruit is indigenisation or localisation. So, businesses where we were earlier importing and are now trying to manufacture locally or after meeting domestic demand, are well positioned to export, are very great opportunities. If you are fine with valuations, the EMS space is interesting. Railways, defence are interesting spaces where the spending is going to remain unabated. We also have the traditional auto component companies and the industrial consumables, which are catering to several end-user segments. I also believe the whole area of specialty steel looks very interesting from a medium to long term perspective.” A large part of your portfolio is tilted towards consumption and these are themes that we have talked about many often as well. Still convinced about that theme, still invested in those names? Nilesh Shah: Absolutely. Within consumption, the whole premiumisation opportunity continues to play out really well and we own a couple of companies in the alcoholic beverages space where these individual companies are riding on premiumisation and the increasing penetration and the increasing acceptance or social acceptance of these products so that is a space we continue to be very constructive about. Hospitality is where the average Indian consumer wants to essentially allocate a good amount of time and their consumption wallets towards the leisure side. So, hospitality continues to be a very exciting opportunity that we are positive about. The third area is, of course, luxury items and the luxury space. So, a whole bunch of consumer businesses driven by both premiumisation and the shift towards luxury products is good and we are playing a basket kind of opportunity here in that entire space. What is the best way to look at manufacturing because now everything is getting connected with manufacturing, whether it is EV or TV. Everybody is now buying stocks in the manufacturing space. Nilesh Shah: Yes. It is a very broad term and the reality is that so far, all of us were just looking at two broad opportunities in India. One is essentially the consumer economy and the other is the digital economy. These were the two big economies. In recent times, the physical economy driven by manufacturing, driven by infrastructure, driven by this whole energy transition, decarbonisation, electrification, all put together are becoming an extremely interesting and meaningful part of the overall investment canvas. Live Events You Might Also Like: Bulk of correction in small, midcaps over; days of IT largecaps are numbered: Nilesh Shah, Envision Capital So, yes, I totally agree that manufacturing is becoming meaningful and I believe that the low hanging fruit is indigenisation, localisation. So, businesses where we were earlier importing and we are now trying to manufacture locally or after meeting the domestic demand, are well positioned to exports, are very great opportunities. It still continues to be a combination. If you are fine with valuations, the EMS space is interesting. Railways, defence is an extremely interesting space where the spending is going to remain unabated. We also have the traditional auto component companies and the industrial consumables, which are catering to several end-user segments. Yes, it is a nice mix of different kinds of opportunities which currently are there and I continue to believe that this is going to be India's decade for manufacturing and to that extent, it is a very relevant and meaningful opportunity for long-term investors. What to your mind could be two or three stocks from the largecap space which you would say have scope to outperform the market in a meaningful manner and where there is a possibility of becoming decent wealth creators in next two-three years? Nilesh Shah: I still think the best is to probably look at the PSU side of it. We do not yet own it meaningfully. I believe that PSUs are in for some kind of a more long-term re-rating. They have kind of re-rated meaningfully, but obviously the stock prices have rallied quite significantly. A correction has set in. It is quite possible that over the course of next, maybe a couple of months or so, if there is further correction, even in the largecap space, the PSUs do offer a great opportunity. Post election, if a fresh bout of reforms come in specifically directed at driving more efficiency among the PSUs, I clearly believe that is going to be a great opportunity. The second is private banks. I think private banks have underperformed over the last two or three years or so. I believe private banks again are poised for good growth. The third is the entire auto pack. The automobile pack is essentially still well poised. They seem to be headed for some strong growth over the medium to long term. You Might Also Like: Renu Baid Pugalia’s top 3 capital goods picks keeping valuation in mind I would think that in the largecap space, these three – PSUs, large private sector banks and automobile companies – can do well. We own some of them here as well. Other than that, there is Reliance which continues to be a good place to be inIt is in the right verticals across energy, retail, digital and that continues to be a very interesting play going forward. We own it as well. When you say autos, that is also as large a pool as manufacturing. What do you like within autos? Nilesh Shah: I clearly believe the passenger vehicle segment looks to be very good across both the passenger car as well as the two-wheeler segment. Both are very interesting pockets. The CV space and the tractor space for now is likely to take a breather. But clearly, the passenger vehicle segment including both cars and two wheelers is an interesting place to be in. Maybe along with the market, you could be more opportunistic and let there be some kind of correction there. But once you see a 5% to 10% correction, this is a good place to be in. And anything within the entire metals basket? Nilesh Shah: We own a metals company called Kalyani Steel where we have invested very recently. It is, of course, a traditional steel company, but has now announced some major plans for investments in specialty steel and titanium so that it can start catering to automotive, aerospace and defence businesses. I believe the whole area of specialty steel looks very interesting from a medium to long term perspective. If we believe that we are going to see a lot of investments in the manufacturing space driven by localisation and indigenisation, all those kinds of businesses will require high quality material suppliers. And within that, clearly, speciality steel looks to be an extremely interesting space. So, we just have one play out there, which we believe is interesting.

US consumer spending warmed slightly in February, according to government data released Thursday, with retail sales regaining ground after an earlier hit from cold weather. Retail sales bounced 0.6 percent last month to $700.7 billion, after January's decline was revised to a wider 1.1 percent, said the Commerce Department. The January drop was the biggest in almost a year, causing some concern. A significant spending slowdown could pour cold water on hopes that consumption continues being a key economic driver. From a year ago, retail sales were up 1.5 percent, said the Commerce Department. Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers helped to support the uptick, rising 1.6 percent between January and February. Excluding autos, retail sales rose by a smaller magnitude at 0.3 percent.

Gas station sales rose 0.9 percent in February. 'Cautious' consumers "Consumers remained cautious in February," said EY chief economist Gregory Daco in a note. He added that sales of building materials and autos drove the February rebound after weather disruptions in January. "We expect consumer spending momentum to cool moderately this year as cost fatigue and softer labor market conditions constrain households' spending power," Daco said. Analysts expect consumer spending growth to have slowed in early 2024, with the rate to be lukewarm in the coming quarters as well. "Only the wealthiest households still have excess pandemic savings, while the cost of credit has jumped and leading indicators point to a rise in layoffs this spring," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He added that the latest data and downward revision to January's figures suggest "consumers are starting to tire." But Michael Pearce, deputy chief US economist at Oxford Economics, expects further job gains and "solid wage gains" to support disposable income growth and in turn, consumer spending this year.

US retail sales rebound in February; weekly jobless claims fall Share The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, increased 17,000 to 1.8 million during the week ending Mar 2. PHOTO: REUTERS Published Thu, Mar 14, 2024 · 09:01 PM US RETAIL sales rebounded in February, driven by increases at auto dealerships and petrol service stations, but consumer spending is slowing as households grapple with inflation and higher borrowing costs. Retail sales rose 0.6 per cent last month, the Commerce Department’s Census Bureau said on Thursday (Mar 14). Data for January was revised lower to show sales tumbling 1.1 per cent, instead of 0.8 per cent as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales, which are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation, rising 0.8 per cent in February. Sales were held down in January in part by frigid temperatures and difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations. With those factors largely out of the way, sales are reverting to a more normal pattern. Retail sales excluding cars, petrol, building materials and food services were unchanged in February. This so-called core retail sales measure corresponds most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product (GDP). Core sales for January were revised to show them decreasing 0.3 per cent, instead of 0.4 per cent as previously reported. Consumer spending is cooling in the first quarter, after helping to fuel economic growth in the October-to-December quarter. Spending, however, remains supported by a fairly tight labour market. Economists see no imminent recession. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting GDP increasing at a 2.5 per cent annualised rate in Q1. The economy grew at a 3.2 per cent pace in Q4. Consumer spending is holding up despite higher inflation, though households are increasingly focusing on essentials and cutting back on discretionary spending. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by 525 basis points to the current 5.25 to 5.5 per cent range since March 2022. The US central bank is expected to start cutting rates by June. A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 209,000 for the week ended Mar 9. Economists had forecast 218,000 claims in the latest week.

Economists had forecast 218,000 claims in the latest week. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, increased 17,000 to 1.811 million during the week ending March 2. The government revised the data for both initial and continuing claims from 2019 through 2023. It also implemented new models to seasonally adjust both initial claims and continued claims this year and the revised seasonal factors for both series from 2019 through 2023.

Leg armor in Dragon's Dogma 2 typically gives a good balance of stats, including all three Defense stats, Knockdown resist, Magick Defense, and both Elemental and Debilitation resist. Leg armor in Dragon's Dogma 2 is often transferable between Vocations, but because of the unique resistances and effects of the best early Leg armor DD2 players can get, some are more useful than others for specific Vocations . Related Dragon's Dogma 2: The Heel of History Walkthrough Complete The Heel of History quest to discover the Gracious Hands’ Vaults archive in Dragon’s Dogma 2. Posts By Nahda Nabiilah Mar 28, 2024 This guide to the best Dragon's Dogma 2 Leg armor early-game players can get does not include recommendations for the Mystic Spearhand , Magick Archer, Trickster, or Warfarer Vocations. These Vocations are unlocked later in the game and don't have much early-game Leg armor to take advantage of. The Thief, Archer, Mage, and Fighter Vocations are all available from the start, while Warrior and Sorcerer can be unlocked soon after reaching Vermund. Best Early Fighter Leg Armor: Lionel Hosen Defense Slash Defense Strike Defense Magick Defense Knockdown Resist Elemental Resist Debilitation Resist Weight 47 N / A N / A 15 11 +5% Lightning +2% Sleep 1.81 Fighters benefit a lot from having gear that gives good balanced stats, and the Lionel Hosen gives resistance to Lightning, Sleep, and decent Magickal and normal defenses. It doesn't have the most in any one stat, but its not bad across the board and will easily carry you into the mid and later game (as long as you remember to upgrade it). To get the Lionel Hosen , Dragon's Dogma 2 players must complete the Nameless Village quests , then purchase it from the Nameless Apothecary for 7,200g. To get to the Nameless Village, either take an Oxcart to Melve and head far to the southeast to the edge of the map, or travel east from Vernmouth on foot. Best Early Mage Leg Armor: Savant's Boots Defense Slash Defense Strike Defense Magick Defense Knockdown Resist Elemental Resist Debilitation Resist Weight 24 N / A N / A 32 8 N / A +2% Sleep, +5% Silenced 1.16 The Savant's boots are very useful for Mages because they are an early source of Silence resist gear. It can be acquired as soon as you get to the capital city of Vermund, Vernworth, and is a very light piece of equipment. It has decent defenses, and very good Magick Defense, though it's not going to do much to prevent a Mage from being knocked down.

Posts By Waseem Muhammad Mar 26, 2024 To get the Savant's Boots , Dragon's Dogma 2 players must purchase it from Bjorn's Armory, in Vernworth, for 6,770g. Bjorn's Armory is located in the central square of Vernworth, just to the right of the stairs that lead to the Pawn Guild. Best Early Archer Leg Armor: Hillfolk Breeches Defense Slash Defense Strike Defense Magick Defense Knockdown Resist Elemental Resist Debilitation Resist Weight 50 N / A N / A 20 15 +2% Fire, +1% Ice +4% Fire, +2% Frostbite, +4% Sleep 2.21 Archers benefit from gear that provides resistances to effects typically applied at a range, but of all the best starting Leg armor pieces in Dragon's Dogma 2 , the Hillfolk Breeches offer the Vocation the most benefit. It has a base 50 Defense, 20 Magick Defense, and a not-too-shabby 15 Knockdown resistance. It also offers a huge suite of resistances, but its 2.21 Weight quite literally weighs down its usefulness in the later game for Archers . To get the Hillfolk Breeches , Dragon's Dogma 2 players must purchase it from Celeste's Smithy, in the Checkpoint Rest Town, for 9,200g. To get here, take the Oxcart on the western side of Vernworth, or follow the main road leading west from the city. Best Early Thief Leg Armor: Thief's Gaiters Defense Slash Defense Strike Defense Magick Defense Knockdown Resist Elemental Resist Debilitation Resist Weight 50 N / A N / A 10 8 N / A +8% Blighted, +2% Silenced, +2% Sleep 1.3 The Thief's Gaiters are the best Thief Leg armor piece for one important reason. Not very many pieces of armor in Dragon's Dogma 2 offer a unique, piece-specific bonus. But the Thief's Gaiters do – while equipped, the wearer's movements are completely silenced. Though the game's Stealth missions are far from difficult, this almost completely negates the need to sneak behind Guards. It can make these missions much faster, and it offers decent defensive stats, too.

This extremely high-Defense and high-Knockdown Resist leg equipment will set a Warrior up for success while leveling the Vocation , and are decent enough to not warrant a replacement until much later in the game. To get the Dauntless Greaves , Dragon's Dogma 2 players must purchase it from Celeste's Smithy, in the Checkpoint Rest Town, for 16,800g. To get here, take the Oxcart on the western side of Vernworth, or follow the main road leading west from the city.

Though the Nightfall Greaves make it easier for the Arisen to be lulled to sleep, it grants a huge bonus to Silence and Fire resistances. It also offers a huge 70 base Defense, a rarity among typical Sorcerer gear, and its 10% Silenced resistance is really just the icing on top. To get the Nightfall Greaves , Dragon's Dogma 2 players must purchase it from Grisha's Armory, in the Sacred Arbor, for 15,800g.

FORT EISENHOWER, Ga. (WJBF) – Fort Eisenhower helped military spouses find jobs on Thursday. “I’ve been a military spouse for about fifteen years,” said Jessica Zieran. “As you know, there’s a lot of relocation, a lot of instability, and things that are unpredictable. One of the things I think that’s so great about having an event like this, is that there’s an opportunity to not just find out about positions, but also to network.” Hiring Our Heroes is a U.S Chamber of Commerce Foundation program that connects the military community with American businesses. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Program and Fort Eisenhower leaders held a hiring event at the installation Thursday for military spouses, and anyone else who was looking to find a job. “It’s fantastic,” said Col. Reginald Evans, the Garrison Commander at Fort Eisenhower. “We had thirty employers and we had well over one-hundred registered job seekers here today. We exceeded what we did last year by over twenty-five.” There were local and national employers there – like the Columbia County School District, Wells Fargo, Boeing, Penske, Goodwill, and more. Military spouses are an important workforce that they’re hoping to tap into. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The HOH said more than half a million veterans and military spouses have found careers through its programs. “Military spouses are some of the most talented candidates that we’ve seen,” said Alayna Robbins, the Senior Program Manager at the event for Hiring Our Heroes. “Not only that, but they are so resilient.” It’s hard for a military spouse to plant roots in their careers. Those at the hiring event said this makes it easier. “What’s super beautiful is its the military’s way of acknowledging the hard work of military spouses,” said Nomi Stanton. “How they are valued, and cherished, and loved, and legitimately part of their soldier’s success story.” For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to WJBF.

Article Content:
At a time when threats to the U.S. from around the world are growing by the day, the biggest one may be from within. The U.S. military continues to face recruitment struggles, plunging public confidence , and a loss of morale by those currently serving. The latest survey of military families paints a stark picture, revealing only 32% of military families say they would now recommend military service. That number is down from 55% in 2016. The biggest issues listed among active duty military members are pay, poor housing options, and lack of childcare or education options for children. The reasons behind this decline in military morale are varied, but experts agree it is a serious issue that threatens our national security every day it is allowed to get worse. "This is a multi-generational, bipartisan problem," says Johnny "Joey" Jones, retired Marine bomb tech, in a recent military roundtable discussion on Fox News . "If you ask me, it goes back to a country that is so spoiled, that it has rested on its laurels." Jones also notes that there's a reason the Marines were the only major service branch to still hit their recruiting goals last year. "(The head of the Marine Corps) told Congress the Marine Corps exists to fight and win our nation's battles, with the same fierce, competitive spirit to win no matter the challenge...that is the mentality that will bring men and women to the military," he says. "They need to feel challenged." Others agree that our military and civilian leadership has lost sight of what the military is supposed to be about. "Instead of focusing on lethality, and making sure that we have the mightiest military on the face of the planet, we have an administration that is entirely focused on ideology," says Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), who is also a military veteran. Former Deputy National Security Advisor KT McFarland believes our current leaders would be wise to follow the strategy used by her one-time boss, President Ronald Reagan, who rebuilt the military after a decade of plunging morale following the Vietnam War. "He increased their pay, he increased defense spending in all the major areas, he had technology advancements," she says. "But most of all, he made people really proud to wear the uniform again."

Kyle Jia/U.S. Marine Corps photo) Military.com | By Joanna Guldin Published March 26, 2024 It's a huge understatement to say that military life is a unique experience. From complicated acronyms to on-base living, dealing with Tricare to transitioning out, many facets of military life can be completely baffling to outsiders. It's not that civilians don't try to understand. It's just that for many folks, military life is something that happens "elsewhere" -- and that "elsewhere" is usually on their TV, through the news, movies or series. Often, those representations of military families, service members and military life aren't accurate and can even verge on reductive. Military families want their civilian neighbors to have an authentic picture of their experiences. Research shows that community connectedness across service and civilian lines makes life better for everyone and improves mission readiness. That's why we want to set the record straight.

Business Aerospace & Defense The Big Disconnect: Defense R&D And Warfighter Capabilities By Michael Brown , Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Michael Brown is a Partner at venture capital firm Shield Capital. Follow Author Mar 26, 2024, 11:53am EDT Share Save Comment ARLINGTON, VA - JANUARY 22: U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel answers questions during a press briefing at the Pentagon January 22, 2015 in Arlington, Virginia. The press briefing was believed to be one of Hagel's last before he departs his role as Secretary of Defense. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) Getty Images A decade ago, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel launched the Defense Innovation Initiative declaring we must “sustain and advance our military superiority for the 21st Century…American dominance…is eroding, and we must…sustain and…expand our advantages even…with more limited resources.” Those words ring even truer today, yet as the Defense Department spends a record level on R&D, these efforts are not formally connected to the requirements or acquisition processes at the Pentagon. These two worlds of R&D and acquisition operate separately. In the language of the Defense Department, technology development or R&D needs to transfer to acquisition or production to get to our warfighters. Innovation Initiatives Proliferate Defense innovation has a strong tradition most visibly from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (created in 1958 as a response to Sputnik). Notably, according to the General Accounting Office, technology transfer is not a primary objective of DARPA. In 2015, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter created four new innovation entities with the objective of increasing technology transfer: the Defense Innovation Unit (which I led 2018-2022) to accelerate the adoption of commercial solutions, the Strategic Capabilities Office to use military systems in ways the world has never seen and doesn't know how to counter, the Defense Digital Service, and the Defense Innovation Board. In 2018, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis created Army Futures Command and the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center. Along the way, AFWERX, NavalX, and Army Applications Lab began to leverage the $1 billion spent each year through Small Business Innovation Research grants. Also in that year, the Pentagon reorganized to increase R&D focus led by a new Undersecretary and another innovation program followed a few years later, the Rapid Defense Experimentation Reserve . Defense R&D Spending Reaches Record MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor Unfortunately, with each new innovation organization and increase in R&D spending, there is no accompanying architecture of how these technologies, commercial solutions or research projects transition to ongoing production or what the military calls programs of record. Programs of record have a management structure, usually a program executive office, which houses the engineers, acquisition staff, test plan, sustainment strategy and budget to field a new capability. The current R&D budget is a record $130 billion (15% of total defense spending) but the research is not explicitly mapped to programs of record which means a high degree of uncertainty as to whether the successful efforts get into warfighters’ hands. The Big Disconnect While many research efforts need time to mature, a closer connection from the many R&D programs to capabilities the Defense Department wants to acquire would be a lot more efficient. In fact, with renewed great power competition, speed in the transition or transfer of R&D to new capabilities is a critical competitive dimension. While traditional defense primes are adept at navigating the Department to channel R&D efforts to programs of record they will likely be awarded, companies outside this ecosystem have difficulty in understanding how warfighters in the field, those that write requirements for new defense systems, contracting staff, and acquisition budgets can be in four separate organizations. This is one reason why just six defense primes are awarded 2/3 of all Pentagon procurement spend. Further, many new capabilities find their way into the budget from outside the Defense Department through Congress. As I saw first-hand, lobbyists and companies influence members of Congress to add defense appropriations targeted at specific capabilities and vendors. While this may serve individual Congressional districts, earmarking appropriations in this way does not optimize for defense priorities or warfighter needs. Acquisition Driven By Requirements and Budget—Not R&D ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA - JULY 21: U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin speaks during a news briefing at the Pentagon July 21, 2021 in Arlington, Virginia. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley held a news briefing to discuss various topics including the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) Getty Images Inexplicably, the defense acquisition system is driven by a separate requirements process to specify what the military needs—which may be informed by research but is without a mechanism to do so. A defined and agreed upon requirement is the starting point for any defense acquisition program—not research in the labs nor a commercial capability already available like small drones or satellite imagery despite Congress requiring the Defense Department to assess commercial capability first. Regardless, the disconnect between research programs and the acquisition system is one of the reasons for the valley of death for non-traditional suppliers: vendors successfully performing on R&D or prototype contracts may be waiting years before there is a requirement written, appropriation request made to Congress and acquisition resources assigned to write a production contract. What private investors see is aspiring suppliers who successfully competed for R&D dollars, like SBIR grants, often with no idea how to transition research wins to ongoing production contracts. From an investor perspective, a research award is interesting but means little without a transition to ongoing revenue. Only when the research informs a requirement and Congress appropriates budget to an acquisition organization—like Army Materiel Command—is a path set for production revenue to a vendor that scales capability for warfighters. The Way Forward: Planned Transitions to Military Customer and Budget Given the proliferated number of defense organizations spending an all-time high level of R&D dollars, mapping the most promising, highest impact and most mature research capabilities to the acquisition system is a long overdue reform. Either the Defense Department or Congress should require transition plans for successful research. Since research without a transition plan to production confines the research to a lab, research projects of any size should be explicitly mapped to a military need and a customer willing to identify budget dollars to acquire the capability. Since research outcomes are uncertain there will not be a one-to-one correlation of research to acquisition, but a system that does not even prioritize this connection is doomed to both waste money and frustrate vendors. We must ensure our record investment in research is connected explicitly to an acquisition system that fields capabilities for our warfighters. American military superiority is eroding fast and speeding research to new capabilities depends on successful transitions to acquisition programs.

Report Missile Defense Keeping Missile Defense at the Heart of Defense Transformation May 7, 2003 3 min read Download Report Baker Spring Former Kirby Research Fellow in National Security Policy Baker is a former Kirby Research Fellow in National Security Policy Copied Select a Section 1 /0 Toggle open close Congress should accept the Bush Administration's proposals for changing the way that the Missile Defense Agency budgets for ballistic missile defense programs. Congress can best advance these proposals by incorporating them into the annual defense authorization legislation, which the House and Senate Armed Services Committees will begin drafting this week. On April 10, the Bush Administration, anticipating the pending legislative action, sent Congress a comprehensive legislative proposal to transform management of the Department of Defense. Entitled the Defense Transformation for the 21st Century Act, it incorporates the Administration's proposals for reforming management of the missile defense program. Fielding an effective global missile defense system is a pressing need because ballistic missile defense programs are lagging behind the emerging missile threat. In the past, U.S. participation in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty severely restricted ballistic missile defense programs. Last year, however, President Bush took the bold step of withdrawing the U.S. from the ABM Treaty. In order to capitalize on this important step, however, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) needs a flexible system for managing what in reality is a complex set of systems and not an individual weapon. The missile defense provisions that the Bush Administration has included in the Defense Transformation for the 21st Century Act are a critical step in putting such a flexible management system in place. The Problems with the Current Funding System The current system funds largely research and development programs in the field of ballistic missile defense and breaks these programs into individual line items or Program Elements. This balkanization of the missile defense budget both defies logic and impedes progress. The current budgeting system for missile defense treats each individual Program Element as an independent item, as if it were unrelated to the other Program Elements in the budget. The Bush Administration's missile defense program, for good reason, is not a series of stand-alone systems. It is an intricate constellation of systems in which each element is integrated with its companion elements. If the MDA decides to make a change to one element of the overall system, it almost certainly affects the design of other elements. Given the complex requirements for integrating the various Program Elements, the Missile Defense Agency needs the flexibility to shift funds between the existing accounts. The current budgeting system for missile defense, however, precludes efficiently shifting funds among accounts. To move funds, the MDA must obtain congressional approval for a "reprogramming request" or in some instances even request legislative changes. Reprogramming is a cumbersome process that can take two or more months. With more time lost, the U.S. missile defense program runs the risk of falling further behind the threat. For example, the Sea-Based Midcourse element moved forward as a result of two successful intercept tests. Therefore, the Missile Defense Agency wanted to accelerate the program by funding long-lead development efforts, explore new technologies, and ultimately provide an initial defense capability. Ultimately, the Missile Defense Agency decided not to take these steps because the time required for obtaining a reprogramming request from Congress convinced MDA that the request was not worth submitting. The process of obtaining legislative changes is even more cumbersome. Yet, constructing ballistic missile defense testing facilities in Alaska required such a legislative change. Two Solutions to the Current Funding Problem The Bush Administration is proposing two solutions to the problem of the balkanized missile defense budget. The first solution is to consolidate all the existing Program Elements in the missile defense budget into a single Program Element. The new consolidated Program Element would be called the Ballistic Missile Defense System. This step would significantly reduce the time required to reallocate funds within the missile defense program and improve the ability of the Missile Defense Agency to field an initial missile defense program for the protection of the U.S., its allies, and U.S. forces deployed abroad against ballistic missile attack. The second solution is to allow the Department of Defense to expend funds for the missile defense program through a single appropriation for the Missile Defense Agency. This will serve to reduce the need for the MDA to request legislative changes, as well as submit reprogramming requests. Conclusion The growing threat to the United States, its allies, and U.S. forces deployed abroad will not wait for the Department of Defense to navigate its existing inefficient budget practices and eventually field a missile defense system. Today, the territory of the United States is completely vulnerable to ballistic missile attack. Every day of delay that results from this inefficient and slow budgeting process is another day the American people remain vulnerable. There is a better way. The Bush Administration has presented a solid proposal to reform the budgeting system for missile defense. Congress, as a result, can take a major step forward in accelerating the ballistic missile defense program by incorporating the Bush Administration's proposals into the annual defense authorization bill.

You can skip our detailed analysis on the subject and head over directly to the 5 Most Powerful Militaries in Latin America . While final figures for 2023 are still awaited, global military expenditure reached a record-high of $2.2 trillion in 2022, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). $961 billion of the total amount was incurred in the Americas, 94% of which was contributed by the United States and Canada. In Latin America – the region comprising parts of North, South and Central America, as well as the Caribbean Islands where Romance languages are predominantly spoken – defense expenditure was measured at $57.2 billion in 2022, at a modest increase of 0.8% compared to 2021. Brazil had the largest share of this expenditure, with over $20 billion spent on military expenses in 2022. The country has been leveraging its economic strength for quite some time now to upgrade its military. In 2014, Brasilia placed an order for 36 Gripen fighter jets from Sweden to enhance its aerial capabilities, for a deal valued at $5.04 billion. Four more jets were added to the contract in 2022. Six of these fighters have been received so far from Sweden, with the remaining set for delivery by 2027. A year earlier, the Brazilian Air Force provided a contract to Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT )’s subsidiary, Sikorsky, to provide logistics support for Brazil’s 16 UH-60L Black Hawk helicopters for a period of four years. Argentina has also been investing heavily to strengthen its military. In June last year, the country ordered six Bell 407GXi helicopters from Textron Inc. (NYSE: TXT ) to perform in critical search and rescue operations in the country’s mountainous terrains. Later in October, the United States approved the transfer of 24 Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) F-16 fighter jets from Denmark to Argentina. According to Argentine newspaper La Nacion, these jets will be equipped with air-to-air missiles and paid for with a $40 million financing package. The approval by Washington to provide Argentina with the F-16s is being seen by analysts as a move to counter Chinese influence in South America. Buenos Aires has been restricted from procuring western military hardware since the Falklands War with the UK in 1982. The Argentines had initially been considering replacing their Dassault Mirage III fighters, which retired back in 2015, with the JF-17 – a joint production of China and Pakistan. Story Continues In a similar manner, Colombia has been offered by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to upgrade and modernize its fleet of fighter jets with the F-16s to counter competing offers made by France’s Dassault Aviation and Swedish company Saab AB. The offer is reportedly backed by officials in Washington. Colombia is the fourth largest spender on defense in Latin America, having incurred over $9.9 billion on defense expenditure in 2022. The South American nation, in separate proposals, has also been offered to buy AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapons from RTX Corporation (NYSE: RTX ) for $225 million, and Harpoon anti-ship missiles from The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA ) for $177 million. 15 Most Powerful Militaries in Latin America Methodology We have considered various metrics to rank the most powerful militaries in Latin America . These include the size of their economy measured in terms of nominal GDP, countries’ defense spending, technological capabilities, number of active military personnel, tanks, armored fighting vehicles, military aircraft fleet, and total naval assets.

Title: Why persistent military interventions will never let Pakistan become a democracy

Trending: PM Modi in Manipur Charlie Kirk killer Sushila Karki IND vs PAK India-US ties New human organ Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale Movie Review Home Opinion Why persistent military interventions will never let Pakistan become a democracy Why persistent military interventions will never let Pakistan become a democracy NC Bipindra • March 10, 2024, 12:03:21 IST Whatsapp Facebook Twitter Pakistan has undergone a transformation wherein various facets of the state are under military control, making it challenging to maintain the essence of democracy Advertisement Subscribe Join Us Add as a preferred source on Google Prefer Firstpost On Google Presently, the military finds itself entangled in a subsequent confrontation with Imran Khan, the favourite of the masses. Image Courtesy: Reuters What facet of the military’s participation in the nation’s political apparatus contributes to its operational dysfunction? Alternatively, what constituent of the military’s involvement propels society towards the precipice of civil conflict? From a subjective standpoint, the military’s influence on decision-making processes, notably in formulating foreign and internal security policies, does not inherently manifest as problematic. Given its precarious geopolitical surroundings, the contextualisation of Pakistan as a security state from its inception underscores the historical roots of such a paradigm. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD The 1990s witnessed the ascendancy of a military-oriented perspective, accentuating assumed internal threats to the nation’s survival. This perspective gained further traction in the aftermath of the post-9/11 security paradigm. More from Opinion Sergio Gor’s senate hearing signals the future of Indo-American ties How Trump’s ‘War on Drugs’ buildup against Venezuela has a hidden agenda The substantial role assumed by the military in shaping foreign and security policies finds its justification in these historical antecedents. Critics of the military’s pervasive role in these processes must proffer pragmatic alternatives, implying the establishment of alternative institutional frameworks to curtail the involvement of military bureaucracy. However, complications arise when the military bureaucracy exploits international linkages forged during policy formulation to consolidate its influence within the country’s power structures. In the post-Musharraf epoch, military leadership assumed the mantle of de facto diplomats for Pakistan. The internal security landscape emerged as the preeminent foreign policy concern for successive governments in Islamabad, prompting foreign leaders, including foreign ministers and heads of state from Western and Muslim nations, to seek consultations primarily with the Chief of Army Staff (COAS). Impact Shorts More Shorts How army remains Pakistan’s biggest business house 60 years on, why 1965 India–Pakistan war still matters The high-profile international visits undertaken by the Army chief were extensively publicised in domestic and international media during this time. This heightened visibility finds rationale in the geopolitical reality that Pakistan and its adjacent Afghanistan were focal points in global terrorist networks, hosting the headquarters of major international terror organisations. A historical context is pertinent, wherein the nexus between the Pak-Afghan border areas and mainland Afghanistan was implicated in major terrorist incidents worldwide. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD In such scenarios, the discernment of a foreign leader is of manageable complexity; the point of contact for addressing such difficulties is perceived to be the Army chief rather than the Prime Minister of Pakistan. The irony is underscored by the conspicuous absence of institutional capacity within the prime minister or the civilian government to formulate policies germane to these concerns. Despite the technical attribution of military capacity within the ambit of the prime minister’s executive powers, the unequivocal proclamations of the military’s media wing regarding its intent to support civil governments on diverse policy matters substantiate the de facto institutional autonomy exercised by the army. This nuanced interplay unfolds within Islamabad’s structured and disciplined bureaucratic milieu, characterised by an absence of tumult or disorder. The constitutional powers of the prime minister are willingly ceded, facilitating the encroachment of the Chief of Army Staff and the military bureaucracy, particularly in scenarios where civilian governments lack the independent capacity for policy formulation and execution. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD However, it is essential to note that this singular dynamic does not make Pakistan’s political system dysfunctional. Comparable instances of military leadership involvement in the formulation and execution of foreign and security policies are observable in other nations. The difficulty associated with the military’s engagement in Pakistan lies primarily in its role as a partisan actor in the nation’s internal political contentions. This predicament is further underscored by the extensive historical record depicting the Pakistani military’s involvement as a participant in ideological, religious, sectarian, and political conflicts. The epoch of General Zia-ul-Haq’s military regime stands out as a significant period wherein the military was ostensibly positioned as the guardian of the state’s ideological frontiers. During this tenure, the military administration actively contributed to the cultivation and reinforcement of profound religious and sectarian divisions within society through legislative measures, persisting as unresolved issues within the broader Pakistani political landscape. Since its inception, Pakistan has manifested itself as an ideologically diverse society, accommodating various political, religious, sectarian, and ideological factions, a characteristic dating back to British colonial rule. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD However, the Zia-led military sought to impose an ideological homogeneity on Pakistani society, endeavouring to enforce a fundamentalist interpretation of Islam at both the social and political strata. Consequently, the military, under Zia’s leadership, assumed a partisan role in ideological, sectarian, and religious conflicts, aligning itself with advocates promoting specific interpretations of Islam, distinct ideological perspectives, and particular sectarian worldviews. This multifaceted involvement raises intricate questions surrounding the military’s role and its impact on the socio-political fabric of Pakistan. In the post-Zia period, a specific cadre of politicians, sectarian leaders, and ideologues emerged within Pakistani society, leveraging the military’s partisan engagement in political, sectarian, and ideological spheres. Following General Zia-ul-Haq’s demise in an air crash, the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) under Benazir Bhutto ascended to power after parliamentary elections. The PPP, subjected to the military’s repressive measures during Zia’s era, was perceived as a potential threat by the incumbent military leadership. Consequently, the military aligned itself with the right-leaning coalition led by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, participating in a political conflict against the left-leaning PPP. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD This trajectory was characterised by non-linearity; as the PPP normalised its relations with the military leadership, the latter shifted its focus towards the sitting leader, Nawaz Sharif. Subsequently, the military’s entrenched partisan role became customary, transforming into an autonomous actor within the political landscape. By the conclusion of General Musharraf’s military government, the military had assumed a permanent partisan role in the political arena, intermittently aligning with various political players—a trend facilitated by the emergence of figures such as Imran Khan openly advocating for the military’s partisan involvement in politics. Imran Khan actively implored military leaders to support his anti-corruption initiatives against political adversaries, particularly during the concluding phases of his governance. Some journalists in Pakistan asserted that the military possessed files detailing the corruption of the Sharif family, with military intelligence officials reportedly confirming and sharing these files. Imran Khan overtly appealed to the military to relinquish their proclaimed neutrality in the no-confidence motion against his government, emphasising the imperative for collaborative efforts against his political opponents. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Imran Khan’s public proclamations elucidated his intention to instrumentalise the military in his anti-corruption campaign against political rivals. Conversely, Nawaz Sharif, while not overtly advocating for the military’s partisan role, strategically appears to derive benefits from its involvement in the country’s political milieu. The imperative for the Pakistani military lies in its transformation into an institution characterised by unwavering non-partisanship. This principle should be theoretical and rigorously practiced across political, social, ideological, and religious spheres. It is paramount for military leaders to comprehend the intricate societal tapestry they are mandated to safeguard, acknowledging its diversity in political affiliations, social structures, ideological orientations, sectarian diversities, and religious beliefs. Persistent partisanship directed against specific segments of society would undermine the fundamental rationale and legitimacy underlying the military’s existence and operational integrity. In such a milieu, confrontations with influential political leaders and groups could be imprudent and detrimental to the institution’s objectives. The post-Musharraf era witnessed an initial manifestation of military leaders adopting a partisan stance against Nawa... [truncated]

15 Countries with the Most Reserve Military Manpower in the World Rabeeta Abbas February 10, 2024 9 min read ^GSPC GD LMT BA In this article, we list and discuss the 15 Countries with the Most Reserve Military Manpower in the World. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Countries with the Most Reserve Military Manpower in the World . According to the World Bank ’s report, a total amount of $2.21 trillion was spent on military expenses worldwide in 2022. However, this comes as no surprise as countries tend to spend a significant portion of their GDP on their military to strengthen defenses and stay competitive in the world, every year. At the same time, there are also some countries with no army, navy, or air force (See: 15 Countries that have no Army, Navy, or Air Force ) but continue to thrive, thanks to the agreements they have with strong countries like the US, France, and Australia to protect them against attacks of any sort. Note that the US, France, and Australia are considered “strong countries” because they have strong economies and powerful militaries (See: 25 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2023 ) to serve and protect the citizens. As of 2024 , the United States is the strongest military in the world, followed by China, Russia and India. But are they also the strongest when it comes to reserve military manpower? Reserve military are soldiers who have serve some years in the military and then join the Army Reserves or National Guard. Reservists get military perks as they are part of the military without devoting themselves full-time to the military. Military benefits from reserve manpower in times of emergencies as they can call reservists anytime to duty when the country is in need. Some countries are facing a decline in their active and reserve manpower despite having a high-end military. For instance, according to Pew Research , 18% of the US population was serving in the military in 1980, but the percentage dropped to 6% in 2022. They've also forecasted that although around 18.3 million veterans in the US, the numbers will decline to 12.1 million in the next 25 years — by 2048. The gradual fall in military manpower is an area of concern for the United States. But still, for now, it is the number one miliary in the world. Military Spending and the Arms and Ammunition Industry In 2022, the US spent $877 billion on its military, which was 3.5% of its total GDP. Military spending by governments surges during wars and conflicts, and companies that manufacture and supply arms and ammunition achieve the most profitable outcomes. During the Ukraine-Russia war, the US’s big five defense contractors made huge profits in 2022 from selling weapons to Ukraine. According to Reuters , the big five MIC companies in defense industry, Boeing (NYSE: BA ), General Dynamics (NYSE: GD ), Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT ), Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC ), and RTX Corporation (NYSE: RTX ) earned $157.5 billion in fiscal year 2023, an increase from $153.6 billion in fiscal year 2022. Story Continues Moreover, in 2023, the sales of U.S. military equipment to foreign governments rose by 16% to a record $238 billion. As the Russia-Ukraine war is ongoing, the defense industry will continue to rise, and the MIC of the United States will continue to make profits. As reported by Global Times , War is "good for business," a recruiter for BlackRock Inc (NYSE: BLK ) told the O'Keefe Media Group. As of February 9, 2024, Australia pledged an additional AUD 400 million to Boeing (NYSE: BA)'s indigenous Ghost Bat autonomous drone program. The government previously signed an AUD 600 million contract with Boeing (NYSE: BA) to sustain and upgrade F/A-18F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler fleets for the Royal Australian Air Force. Similarly, in December 2023, Ordnance and Tactical Systems, a business unit of General Dynamics (NYSE: GD), was awarded a $654.5 million contract by the Army Contracting Command of Newark, NJ for the metal parts program for M1128. General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) was selected alongside IMT Defense for this contract, and both companies will be competing for each order of the contract. On the other hand, Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), a US weapons manufacturer, signed contracts with some leading Saudi companies at the World Defense Show in Riyadh on 5 February 2024. The company awarded Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) subcontracts to a pair of Saudi Arabian firms, Middle East Propulsion Company (MEPC) and Arabian International Company (AIC), for locally manufacturing parts of Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) missile system. As geopolitical changes and conflicts are occurring more often than before, countries heavily depend on their military, including the army, navy, and air force, to defend the country in crucial times. In the list below, we discuss the top countries with the most reserve military manpower in the world. 15 Countries with the Most Reserve Military Manpower in the World Glynnis Jones / Shutterstock Our Methodology Countries with the most reserve military manpower in the world are listed in ascending order of the size of their reserve force.

Wednesday, November 12, 2025 Advertise with us News SEARCH NEWS NEWS HOME » BUSINESS Tawhaki National Aerospace Centre provides mission-critical boost for aerospace sector Share Tweet COMMENT Business | February 9, 2024 1:24:33 PM IST PRNewswire Christchurch [New Zealand], February 9: Aotearoa has reinforced its place in the global aerospace industry with the opening of the Tawhaki National Aerospace Centre and the new sealed runway at Kaitorete, today. The new infrastructure coupled with technical support will supercharge Aotearoa's fast-growing aerospace sector and help meet international demand. Domestic and international companies are already testing and trialling leading-edge technologies at Kaitorete, a short 50-minute drive from Otautahi Christchurch CBD and now more crafts and companies can take flight. US-based Wisk Aero recently conducted its world-first airspace integration test flights for an uncrewed aircraft from Kaitorete and Dawn Aerospace and Kea Aerospace will now be able to conduct horizontal space launches and stratospheric flights from the site. The new 1-kilometre runway and planned hangar facilities were funded by a $5.4 million grant from the New Zealand Government's Regional Strategic Partnership Fund, administered by Kanoa. This joins a sealed taxiway and fuel pad, grass runway, vertiport, office facilities and data connections. Tawhaki Board Member David Perenara-O'Connell said mana whenua (indigenous people) of Kaitorete were proud to be at the forefront of supporting the country's aerospace sector and acknowledged their partnership with the New Zealand Government in the Tawhaki Joint Venture. "To fully enable the sector, supply chains and realise the economic benefits for all New Zealanders, takes a collaborative approach. We're grateful for the support of our government, local authorities, regulators, aerospace partners, research and science communities, and suppliers who share our vision of a world-leading hub for innovation and exploration. "We believe that this mission is truly unique. The way in which we weave together matauranga Maori (indigenous knowledge) with cutting-edge innovation in aerospace and environmental rejuvenation, marks a new era in sustainable land use." Aotearoa is one of the top countries for space launches and aerospace testing and trialling, with an advanced and responsive regulatory environment, sparse population and low air and sea traffic. Kaitorete offers clear skies and access to a wide range of orbits from an expansive, unpopulated, flat strip of land 25km long, nestled between Te Waihora (Lake Ellesmere) and the Pacific Ocean. Its proximity to world-class universities, international air and seaports and advanced manufacturing capabilities in nearby Otautahi Christchurch is globally unique. Tawhaki Chief Executive Linda Falwasser said the Joint Venture was taking a staged approach to its developments, with the potential to support vertical space launch in future. "We have one of the world's best locations for aerospace and space launch and we're prioritising critical infrastructure alongside rejuvenation of this special whenua (land). This includes exploring solar power and green hydrogen production and storage on site. "We have received strong global demand for a site that delivers technically while holding steadfastly to its values of protecting and preserving our people and planet." "Having this key infrastructure so accessible is hugely enabling for the whole sector," said Dawn Aerospace Co-Founder James Powell. "It will be transformative to the development of our rocket-powered aircraft, the Mk-II Aurora." Kea Aerospace CEO Mark Rocket said Tawhaki is enabling an exciting future for the region and the country. "Kaitorete is situated in an ideal location for aerospace research and development and offers Kea Aerospace unique opportunities for flight testing and operations of our solar-powered stratospheric aircraft."

The new sealed, 1km-long, 30m-wide runway at Tāwhaki National Aerospace Centre. (PRNewsfoto/Tāwhaki) Domestic and international companies are already testing and trialling leading-edge technologies at Kaitorete, a short 50-minute drive from Ōtautahi Christchurch CBD and now more crafts and companies can take flight. US-based Wisk Aero recently conducted its world-first airspace integration test flights for an uncrewed aircraft from Kaitorete and Dawn Aerospace and Kea Aerospace will now be able to conduct horizontal space launches and stratospheric flights from the site. The new 1-kilometre runway and planned hangar facilities were funded by a $5.4 million grant from the New Zealand Government's Regional Strategic Partnership Fund, administered by Kānoa. This joins a sealed taxiway and fuel pad, grass runway, vertiport, office facilities and data connections. Tāwhaki Board Member David Perenara-O'Connell said mana whenua (indigenous people) of Kaitorete were proud to be at the forefront of supporting the country's aerospace sector and acknowledged their partnership with the New Zealand Government in the Tāwhaki Joint Venture. "To fully enable the sector, supply chains and realise the economic benefits for all New Zealanders, takes a collaborative approach. We're grateful for the support of our government, local authorities, regulators, aerospace partners, research and science communities, and suppliers who share our vision of a world-leading hub for innovation and exploration. "We believe that this mission is truly unique. The way in which we weave together mātauranga Māori (indigenous knowledge) with cutting-edge innovation in aerospace and environmental rejuvenation, marks a new era in sustainable land use." Aotearoa is one of the top countries for space launches and aerospace testing and trialling, with an advanced and responsive regulatory environment, sparse population and low air and sea traffic. Kaitorete offers clear skies and access to a wide range of orbits from an expansive, unpopulated, flat strip of land 25km long, nestled between Te Waihora (Lake Ellesmere) and the Pacific Ocean. Its proximity to world-class universities, international air and seaports and advanced manufacturing capabilities in nearby Ōtautahi Christchurch is globally unique. Tāwhaki Chief Executive Linda Falwasser said the Joint Venture was taking a staged approach to its developments, with the potential to support vertical space launch in future. "We have one of the world's best locations for aerospace and space launch and we're prioritising critical infrastructure alongside rejuvenation of this special whenua (land). This includes exploring solar power and green hydrogen production and storage on site. "We have received strong global demand for a site that delivers technically while holding steadfastly to its values of protecting and preserving our people and planet." "Having this key infrastructure so accessible is hugely enabling for the whole sector," said Dawn Aerospace Co-Founder James Powell . "It will be transformative to the development of our rocket-powered aircraft, the Mk-II Aurora." Kea Aerospace CEO Mark Rocket said Tāwhaki is enabling an exciting future for the region and the country. "Kaitorete is situated in an ideal location for aerospace research and development and offers Kea Aerospace unique opportunities for flight testing and operations of our solar-powered stratospheric aircraft."

An increasing number of "space fans" are coming to Wenchang, Hainan Province, the site of China's youngest spaceport, to see the rockets, and the city's space-themed tourism is becoming more and more popular. The 2,100-year-old town in the northeastern part of Hainan Island is becoming "China's version of Cape Canaveral". Tourists watch a rocket launch at Qishui Bay, Longlou Town, Wenchang. In recent years, Wenchang has been actively exploring the "aerospace +" model to develop tourism. Facilities such as seaside B&Bs and local featured farmhouses have been built in response to the trend, and an aerospace tourism town is now taking shape. When rocket launches and tropical island scenery perfectly combine, the former hometown of overseas Chinese has undergone tremendous changes- transforming into a well-known destination of aerospace coastal tourism in China. Wenchang has attracted many young photographers to "chase rockets" whenever there is a launch. In their opinion, this is the closest that ordinary people can get to space. "No matter how many times I watch a rocket launch, I'm always deeply moved to tears" said space photographer and sophomore at Northwest Minzu University Tang Muzhi. He added that he hoped his photos would attract more people's attention and love to space. Zhang Zuoxing, also a photography enthusiast, wanted to share this mind-blowing experience to more people and set up "Walking at 20", a youth travel organization, after graduating from university in 2020 with his friends. They aim at providing immersive trips and social opportunities for young people. The "Wenchang Rocket Chasing Tour" has become the company's best product. Watching rockets in the gentle sea breeze has become a must experience for many tourists in Wenchang. According to Ye Sheng, in charge of Longlou Town, Wencheng, which has a population of only 27,000, it transpires that they have received more than 1.5 million tourists in the past two years because of the aerospace industry. Over 9,000 jobs have been created, and the aerospace tourism industry has achieved an increase in annual income of 15 percent. Local people have benefited greatly as more and more aerospace-themed cultural and tourism activities are being held there. Their door to the outside world has been truly opened, bringing in new knowledge and understandings. "During important holidays and launches, we are always fully booked." said You Zhuo, who runs the Wenchang Ruoyuan Yuanshe B&B. Take an example of the launch of the "Wentian" laboratory cabin module in July 2022, this single event brought more than 200,000 tourists to Longlou Town, creating a boom in demand for hotels, B&Bs, restaurants, and other related services. Some hotels even achieved record revenues of more than one million yuan in a single day. B&Bs along the coast of Qishui Bay, Longlou Town, Wenchang, where people can watch a rocket launch on the balcony of their accommodation or on the beach. Photo credit: Guo Cheng, Xinhua News Agency Thanks to the aerospace industry, a very distinctive tourism sector has been developing in full swing, supporting the businesses of local B&Bs, farmhouse stays, leisure fisheries, sightseeing industries, science tours, and other touristic offers. At the same time, aerospace communities, aerospace schools, aerospace markets, and other supporting facilities have been gradually improved as well. Rocket launches have not only brought a "tourism craze" to Wenchang and improved the living standards of local residents, but also driven the transformation of the city's industrial system. As China's only commercial space launch site, Hainan commercial launch site is the major infrastructure project of Wenchang International Aerospace City, which will be able to launch regularly in 2024. So far, public platforms for aerospace science and innovation, such as the satellite assembly and testing plant, rocket assembly plant, and aerospace supercomputing center, have been completed and gradually put into use. Liu Chong, Mayor of Wenchang, said that Wenchang will gradually form its industrial advantage based on the commercial aerospace industry, accelerate the construction of the industrial system of "three chains" (rocket chain, satellite chain, and data chain) and the "aerospace +", while continuing to drive the transformation and upgrading of the traditional advantageous industries such as Wenchang chicken, coconuts, and fishery. It is foreseeable that the "aerospace craze" based on the "aerospace effect" will drive more industries to gather and grow in Wenchang, and China's commercial aerospace industry will usher in a brilliant new chapter in the future.

Courtesy of the Ministry of National Defense Published Feb 7, 2024 11:44 am KST Updated Feb 7, 2024 3:32 pm KST Korea and Qatar have signed an initial agreement to strengthen bilateral defense cooperation during talks between their defense chiefs, officials said Wednesday, amid Seoul's push to boost arms exports to the Middle East. Defense Minister Shin Won-sik signed the memorandum of understanding (MOU) as he met Qatar's Deputy Prime Minister Khalid bin Mohamed Al Attiyah, who doubles as minister of state for defense, in Doha on Tuesday (local time). Under the MOU, the two countries will hold regular defense ministerial talks and make efforts to establish an institutional foundation for defense cooperation, according to Shin's ministry. The two sides also agreed to strengthen cooperation in various defense sectors, such as increasing exchange between their defense-related institutes and expanding combined drills, it said. Earlier in the day, Shin paid a courtesy call on Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and vowed to further develop their defense ties, citing the 50th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral relations this year. The minister's visit came after President Yoon Suk Yeol made a state visit to Qatar last October, when the two countries agreed to upgrade their relations to a "comprehensive strategic partnership." Shin also attended Korea's football match against Jordan on Tuesday in the semifinals of the Asian Football Confederation Asian Cup in Qatar at the invitation of the emir. Korea lost 2-0. It marked Shin's last trip of a three-nation Middle East swing, which also took him to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. (Yonhap) Go to Top

A street is festooned with posters of Pakistan's former Prime Minister and leader of the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) party, Nawaz Sharif, in Lahore on February 4, 2024, ahead of national elections. (Photo | AFP) The Conversation Updated on : 06 Feb 2024, 5:15 pm 3 min read Copied Pakistan’s former prime minister, Imran Khan, has been sentenced to seven years in prison after a Pakistani court ruled his marriage un-Islamic and illegal. Khan had already been sentenced to 14 years in jail for corruption and barred from holding public office for ten years a week earlier and, a day before that, ten years in prison for leaking official state secrets. Khan claims that the cases against him are politically motivated. Since being deposed in 2022, Khan has taken aim at the country’s powerful military, which has a long history of interfering in politics. He has accused the army chief, the military establishment, and the US government of conspiring against him. Now he argues that military leadership have orchestrated his imprisonment so he cannot run in the upcoming general election on February 8. Members of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party have also been imprisoned or pressured into leaving their positions, and workers have been prevented from holding political rallies in the run-up to the election. The relentless harassment and intimidation of the PTI and its supporters, and the favour shown to Nawaz Sharif of the opposition Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) party, has led to a muted election campaign . Sharif has been prime minister three times but was ousted in 2017. Khan will appeal his convictions and is likely to get some relief from the courts. But one thing is clear: the military has no intention of allowing a free and fair election on February 8. Military dominance The military’s organisation, structures, and practices were developed under the British (who ruled what is now Pakistan until independence in 1947). But its expansion into politics is rooted in the persistent fear of war with India, its desire to control foreign policy, and its wish to protect its budgetary allocations and fiscal interests. In 2022, military expenditure accounted for nearly 18% of government spending in Pakistan, making the military the best-resourced institution in the country. It is also a business conglomerate and owns millions of acres of public land. And it has received considerable military assistance as a frontline ally of the US during its engagements in Afghanistan. The military has long looked to prevent the election of anyone who might try to influence policies that diverge from its entrenched interests. In 2017, Sharif, who was then prime minister, fell out of favour with the military following disagreements about normalising relations with India. Sharif was arrested on charges of corruption and sentenced to ten years in jail less than two weeks before the 2018 general election. Khan won that election with the backing of the military . But, despite starting his time in office by being on “one page” with the military and ceding alarming amounts of political space to them, Khan’s relationship with the military soon turned sour. Tensions exploded when Khan tried to retain Lieutenant-General Faiz Hameed as the military spy chief, rejecting the nominee of army chief General Qamar Bajwa. In April 2022, Khan was ousted from power in a vote of no confidence. He accused the US of engineering his removal and made numerous claims that challenged the military directly. He alleged that the then army chief held a grudge against him, that the military had arrested and tried to assassinate him, and that the military was “above the law.” Khan’s accusations culminated in his arrest on corruption charges on May 9 2023. His imprisonment has resulted in an unprecedented public backlash against the military. Khan’s supporters attacked state institutions and military installations, even breaching the army’s headquarters. Hundreds of PTI supporters were arrested and the military vowed to “punish” them, handing many over to military courts in violation of international law. Three military officials were sacked for their role in the unrest. Since then, the military has by all accounts tightened its grip over Pakistan’s politics, even publicly admitting to meddling in politics. Overdue polls Pakistan’s national elections were supposed to be held in November 2023. But they were delayed due to the need to redraw constituency boundaries following a census. Many are sceptical of this claim and have questioned the ability of Pakistan’s electoral commission to conduct fair polls. The lead-up to the delayed polls has been marred by violence . And, though the polls are expected to go ahead, the electoral commission has asked for security support from the military. Meanwhile, the PTI has faced persistent harassment. Its website is blocked in Pakistan and the party has faced legal setbacks such as losing its electoral symbol, the cricket bat, for not holding intra-party elections. The continuing harassment and intimidation of PTI supporters may also have a chilling effect on voters. No election in Pakistan can be called free and fair for as long as the military establishment continues to play kingmaker. The election on February 8 is no different. The military’s political engineering has ensured that it is impossible for there to be a level playing field for the parties on election day. It only remains to be seen if citizens will turn out to exercise their right to vote.

The new round brings the total financing raised by Heart Aerospace since its inception to $145 million. Among new investors is Sagitta Ventures, a Danish investor focused on early-stage companies. Other investors include Air Canada, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, European Innovation Council Fund, EQT Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, Norrsken VC, United Airlines, and Y Combinator. 'We couldn't be more excited about this round," said Anders Forslund, co-founder, and CEO of Heart Aerospace. "This investment furthers our mission to decarbonize and democratize air travel. Air travel is globally its infancy. Billions of people around the world are looking to be connected to this amazing infrastructure over the next decade. Meanwhile, the industry has committed to net zero emissions by 2050. The only way forward is to decouple the tremendous growth in aviation from its emissions, and we believe ES-30 is the first stepping stone. Moreover, because of the superior economics of electric aircraft over their fossil-fuel counterparts, the ES-30 will bring back service to communities that have lost connectivity and open many new markets. This upcoming year is an exciting one for Heart Aerospace as we prepare to unveil our full-scale aircraft demonstrator." In addition to announcing new funding, Heart Aerospace said EQT Ventures partner Ted Persson will be joining the company's Board of Directors. "As someone said, the stone age didn't end because we ran out of stones and the fossil fuel age won't end because we run out of fossil fuels. Heart Aerospace is taking decarbonization to the skies and we're proud to be funding technology that will fundamentally change the aviation industry," said Ted Persson. "We believe that sustainable industrial and electrification solutions are not just the future; they are the present, and our investment strategy reflects our unwavering commitment to driving positive change in these critical sectors." "Ted brings to Heart Aerospace's Board a wealth of expertise in product design, user experience, storytelling and branding," said John Slattery, Chairman of Heart Aerospace's Board of Directors. "We are delighted to have him on our team." Heart Aerospace intends to use the funds to further build its business and make progress toward type certification of the company's first hybrid-electric airplane, the ES-30. The ES-30 is a regional airplane with a seating capacity of 30 passengers that offers lower emissions, lower noise pollution and lower operating costs on short haul routes than current conventionally fueled airplanes. The ES-30 is currently the only clean sheet hybrid-electric airplane of its size with an active type certification application with European Union Aviation Safety Agency, EASA. The focus in the upcoming year will be on the development of Heart Aerospace's hybrid- electric powertrain. "United's goal of net zero emissions requires bold solutions and that's why we've invested in a broad portfolio of low-carbon technologies including hybrid-electric aircraft," said United Airlines Ventures Managing Director Andrew Chang. "Once operational, we believe Heart's ES-30 aircraft have the potential to reduce our carbon footprint, while serving regional markets across the country." "Air Canada has adopted a multi-pronged approach to addressing its ambitious net zero emissions by 2050 climate change goal, from advocating for commercial scaling of Sustainable Aviation Fuels to active investment in a range of revolutionary new technologies. Further to our initial equity position in Heart Aerospace to support the development of the ES-30 hybrid-electric regional aircraft which could be deployed in Air Canada's regional markets, we recently strengthened our financial investment in Heart Aerospace with an additional US$5 million to advance the ES-30 aircraft towards type certification," said Michael Rousseau, President & Chief Executive Officer at Air Canada. Heart Aerospace has 250 orders for the ES-30, with options and purchase rights for an additional 120 planes. The company also has letters of intent for a further 191 airplanes.

Park Aerospace Corp's Dividend Analysis GuruFocus Research January 1, 2024 3 min read Understanding the Sustainability of Park Aerospace Corp's Dividend Park Aerospace Corp ( NYSE:PKE ) recently announced a dividend of $0.13 per share, payable on 2024-02-02, with the ex-dividend date set for 2024-01-02. As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into Park Aerospace Corp's dividend performance and assess its sustainability. What Does Park Aerospace Corp Do? Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with PKE. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock? Park Aerospace Corp designs, develops, and manufactures advanced composite materials, structures, and assemblies for the aerospace markets, including low-volume and prototype tooling. Its primary business segment is Aerospace, with the majority of its revenue stemming from North America, though it also operates in Asia and Europe. Park Aerospace Corp offers products such as Advanced Composite Prepregs for Aircraft Structures and Interiors, Sigma Strut, and Alpha Strut. Park Aerospace Corp's Dividend Analysis A Glimpse at Park Aerospace Corp's Dividend History Park Aerospace Corp has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 1985, distributing dividends on a quarterly basis. It has increased its dividend each year since 1998, earning the status of a dividend aristocrata title awarded to companies with at least 26 consecutive years of dividend increases. Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share to track historical trends. Breaking Down Park Aerospace Corp's Dividend Yield and Growth As of today, Park Aerospace Corp currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.23% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 3.40%, indicating an expected increase in dividend payments over the next year. The 5-year yield on cost for Park Aerospace Corp stock is approximately 3.24%. Park Aerospace Corp's Dividend Analysis The Sustainability Question: Payout Ratio and Profitability To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. As of 2023-08-31, Park Aerospace Corp's dividend payout ratio is 0.88, which may suggest a potential concern for dividend sustainability. Conversely, Park Aerospace Corp's profitability rank is 8 out of 10 as of 2023-08-31, indicating good profitability prospects and a history of net profit in 9 out of the past 10 years. Story Continues Growth Metrics: The Future Outlook For dividend sustainability, robust growth metrics are crucial. Park Aerospace Corp's growth rank of 8 out of 10 suggests a positive growth trajectory relative to competitors. However, the company's revenue has seen an average annual decrease of -3.30%, underperforming approximately 67.68% of global competitors. The 3-year EPS growth rate has increased by an average of 1.30% per year, yet this underperforms about 55% of global competitors. Additionally, the 5-year EBITDA growth rate of -8.70% underperforms 80.31% of global competitors. Next Steps In conclusion, while Park Aerospace Corp has a strong history of dividend payments and is recognized as a dividend aristocrat, the current payout ratio and mixed growth metrics present a nuanced picture. The robust profitability rank provides some reassurance, yet the underperformance in revenue and EBITDA growth rates warrant careful consideration for the future. Investors should weigh these factors when assessing the long-term sustainability of Park Aerospace Corp's dividends.

View Market Dashboard PARTNERED TMEIC India Facilitating the Transition to Renewable Energy Sources In terms of green energy, TMEIC India produces PV inverters that are delivered both in India and globally. The cumulative shipment of PV inverters made by TMEIC India totals around 29GW or 32,126 in terms of quantity as of 2023. HT Brand Studio Published 17 Feb 2024, 05:39 PM IST TMEIC India As a significant contributor of products and services to the renewable energy sector, TMEIC (Toshiba Mitsubishi-Electric Industrial Systems Corporation) is advancing towards the goal of achieving carbon neutrality. Within its expansive network, TMEIC India, a Group company, plays a vital role in developing key solutions for the energy sector. Focused on providing environmentally sustainable energy solutions, TMEIC India is striving to facilitate the transition to cleaner energy sources. With manufacturing rotating machinery and power electronics, including motors, drives, PV inverters, and UPS (uninterruptible power supply), TMEIC India is aligned with TMEIC’s vision of “reshaping the future of energy,” said Hemant Joshi, Managing Director, TMEIC India. “The energy-efficient solutions that are designed, developed, and manufactured here in India,” said Joshi, add value to the customers’ pursuit of carbon neutrality. Energy Resource Solutions TMEIC’s Energy Resource Solutions (ERS) compasses three key concepts: Smart Factory, Green Energy, and Energy Management. While Energy Management involves electrification, energy-saving, and power supply transformation, green energy involves manufacturing PV inverters for renewable energy source plants, contributing to the growth of PV plants and wind power plants. Smart Factory, characterised by digital transformation (DX) and high efficiency, is another pillar of TMEIC's strategy. “In the realm of wind power, a recent achievement includes the delivery of an 800kW-4P generator for a wind power plant, currently undergoing testing, showcases TMEIC’s dedication to advancing rotating machinery for efficient and reliable wind power generation,” said Hemant Sawarkar, ERS Project Member, TMEIC India. Beyond manufacturing, TMEIC India provides solutions through power electronic technology. In terms of green energy, TMEIC India produces PV inverters that are delivered both in India and globally. The cumulative shipment of PV inverters made by TMEIC India totals around 29GW or 32,126 in terms of quantity as of 2023. Adopting Green Energy In its efforts to advance the use of green energy, the TMEIC India factory’s rooftop is installed with solar panels and is “currently a zero-emission facility,” said Sawarkar. TMEIC’s rotating machinery exhibits precise power with energy savings and reduction of carbon footprint across varied applications. In the realm of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), TMEIC plays a crucial role with high-power, water-cooled MV Drives, along with large capacity synchronous motors. “Our high-capacity motors manufactured in India since 2016 are high-efficiency motors, meeting market needs and various specifications,” said Sawarkar TMEIC India offers high-efficiency series fin frame motors, sourcing approximately 97 per cent of components locally. This approach helps the company enhance its supply network, not only within India but also in the Middle East. This expansion contributes to the stability of plant operations, while also reducing logistics costs and energy consumption. Current Focus In 2021, TMEIC launched a company-wide project to build ideas and develop solutions for energy resources. Tohru Fukiage, ERS Project Manager, TMEIC, said, “Through our activities so far, we have come to focus on developing advanced rectifiers to be applied to the electrolytic hydrogen and new power converters and electric furnaces.” Anticipating a significant business expansion, TMEIC’s initiatives will continue to help the customers achieve their carbon neutrality goals. As Fukiage foresees the power network to become highly unstable in the near future, the current focus of the company lies in advancing “towards a sustainable and carbon-neutral future.” Click here to learn more about TMEIC India: Technology, Products and Automation Solutions for Industries Worldwide | TMEIC Disclaimer: This article has been produced on behalf of the brand by HT Brand Studio.

Article Content:
ST. LOUIS COUNTY, Mo. – Ameren Missouri is planning to build a natural gas-fueled energy center in south St. Louis County on the grounds of a former coal-fired power plant. Ameren announced plans for the Castle Bluff Energy Center earlier this week near the confluence of the Meramec and Mississippi rivers. The company describes the plant as a backup source of energy that’s “designed to bolster grid reliability” and “deliver energy on the hottest summer days, the coldest winter days or when renewable energy is not generating as forecasted.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Water rescue underway in Washington to find man who may have entered Missouri River Ameren says the energy center would create new jobs and sources of revenue for the St. Louis region while also dropping carbon dioxide emissions by 40% compared to its previous coal site, which closed near the end of 2022. The new energy center also aims to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by 80% and sulfur dioxide emissions by 99%. The Castle Bluff Energy Center needs approval from the Missouri Public Service Commission, but with it, construction could start as soon as 2025.

Photo Release MANILA, Philippines — Energy management and digital automation firm Schneider Electric is urging Philippine data centers to use the “green approach” as part of smart and sustainable solutions to lessen energy consumption. Schneider Electric business development and marketing director Carlos Leviste said data centers have become integral to the country’s rapidly growing internet economy. “The need to transition to sustainable operations has become more pronounced,” Leviste said. According to Leviste, data centers have previously utilized fuel to run its operations, marking the facilities as “energy-intensive.” Schneider Electric said data centers should shift to electricity and digital, specifically energy management systems and digital tools, which promote sustainability and operational efficiency. “Data centers, equipped with smarter operations, can optimize costs, speed and capital to prepare them for future technological integrations and risk mitigation,” the firm said. Schneider Electric offers solutions for data centers to improve efficiency and sustainability through American Power Conversion, which offers high-efficiency uninterruptible power supplies, cooling units and monitoring systems. It said the oil-free cooling centrifugal compressors with magnetic bearings chiller systems allows data centers to consume power more efficiently and sustainably. “Through these solutions, data center facilities can reduce operational costs in design and engineering, function using grid-compliant assets and software with reduced cybersecurity risks and ensure proactive maintenance of assets to maintain optimum uninterrupted performance,” Schneider Electric power and grid sales leader for Asia Pacific Sara El Fanidi said. More energy companies are also launching data center solutions for sustainability. Singapore-based Enercon Asia is supporting rapidly growing industries such as microgrids and data centers. Enercon’s Remote Energy Monitoring System, alongside the Data Center Power System solutions will support businesses in adapting to the “ever-changing landscape of energy consumption efficiency.” “Through site verification, measurement, monitoring, and analysis with state-of-the-art smart energy monitoring equipment, our teams ensure that clients have a thorough understanding of their energy consumption patterns, on top of meeting compliance requirements,” Enercon CEO Roland Lim said. The CEO said on Thursday that Enercon’s solution furnishes businesses with insights into their energy consumption patterns. “Moreover, it facilitates remote monitoring of facilities’ energy usage, empowering businesses with enhanced control and efficiency in overseeing their energy resources,” Lim said. International research organization on global data centers Uptime Institute sees a 500-percent growth in data generated globally from 2019 to 2025. The operations of data centers are energy-intensive accounting for about one percentof global electricity consumption. ENERGY BrandSpace Articles 50 winners of P50,000?

JUNO BEACH, Fla. , Feb. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The board of directors of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE ) declared a regular quarterly common stock dividend of $0.515 per share, an approximate 10% increase versus the prior-year comparable quarterly dividend. This increase is consistent with the plan announced in 2022 of targeting roughly 10% annual growth in dividends per share through at least 2024, off a 2022 base. The dividend is payable on March 15, 2024 , to shareholders of record on Feb. 27, 2024 . The board also approved an updated dividend policy beyond 2024, which is expected to translate to a growth rate in dividends per share of roughly 10% per year through at least 2026, off a 2024 base, which is expected to be $2.06 per share. "The board's approval to continue to grow our dividends per share in excess of our expected adjusted earnings per share growth rate is a result of our success in executing on our industry-leading business strategy," said John Ketchum , chairman, president and chief executive officer of NextEra Energy. "With a 59% payout ratio at the end of 2023, below the peer average of approximately 65%, and the continued strength of the earnings and operating cash flow growth at NextEra Energy, we remain well positioned to support the dividend policy going forward. I believe we continue to offer a best-in-class total return potential, with above-average dividend growth and clear visibility to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in each year through 2026, while maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings."

The dividend is payable on March 15, 2024 , to shareholders of record on Feb. 27, 2024 . The board also approved an updated dividend policy beyond 2024, which is expected to translate to a growth rate in dividends per share of roughly 10% per year through at least 2026, off a 2024 base, which is expected to be $2.06 per share. "The board's approval to continue to grow our dividends per share in excess of our expected adjusted earnings per share growth rate is a result of our success in executing on our industry-leading business strategy," said John Ketchum , chairman, president and chief executive officer of NextEra Energy. "With a 59% payout ratio at the end of 2023, below the peer average of approximately 65%, and the continued strength of the earnings and operating cash flow growth at NextEra Energy, we remain well positioned to support the dividend policy going forward. I believe we continue to offer a best-in-class total return potential, with above-average dividend growth and clear visibility to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in each year through 2026, while maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings."

The Next ExxonMobil? 3 Energy Stocks That Investors Shouldn’t Ignore InvestorPlace Feb. 16, 2024, 06:43 AM InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Energy stocks , crucial for powering homes, businesses, and vehicles, saw their stocks dip slightly in 2023. Yet investors, like Fidelity’s energy sector portfolio manager, are optimistic for 2024 , pointing to tight supply, robust demand, and higher production investments as reasons for potential growth in energy stocks. Among these, Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM ) has been standing out as a leader in oil and gas exploration, production, refining, and marketing. Its comprehensive involvement in the energy field offers investors a varied portfolio. Inspired by its success, many energy companies have also thrived in the industry, reaching high potential. Furthermore, Morningstar predicts that the U.S. electricity demand will grow by 1.4% annually until 2032 , with solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal companies leading this surge. This growth, along with stable oil prices, presents a promising outlook despite the ongoing volatility, showcasing a sector rich in both traditional and innovative investment opportunities. So, let’s explore the three energy stocks investors shouldn’t ignore. Energy Stocks: Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD ) stands out in the energy sector by providing essential services to a diverse client base in crude oil, natural gas, and natural liquid gas markets. Over the past year, EPD’s share price has risen by 0.8% . Impressively, the company offers a strong dividend yield of 7.6% , supported by 25 consecutive years of distribution growth as of 2023. In a recent financial showcase, EPD reported a revenue surge to $14.62 billion , marking a 7.12% increase year-over-year ( YOY ). Earnings-per-share ( EPS ) also exceeded expectations by 4 cents, coming in at 72 cents. Furthermore, the firm upped its cash distribution by 5.1% after completing $3.5 billion in capital growth projects. Moreover, EPD showcased its operational efficiency by launching two new natural gas processing plants in the second half of 2023. These facilities quickly reached full capacity, underscoring the high demand for EPD’s services. TipRanks analysts echo the positive sentiments , giving EPD a ‘strong buy’ rating with a 22.15% upside potential. NextEra Energy (NEE) Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE ) shines brightly in the renewable energy cosmos due to its vast wind and solar endeavors. The Cavendish NextGen Hydrogen Hub in Okeechobee County, Florida, showcases the company’s pioneering spirit. This clean hydrogen facility stands as a testament to NextEra’s commitment to exploring sustainable energy innovations. Financially, NextEra Energy showed potential as its EPS of 52 cents soared past Wall Street predictions, alongside a revenue triumph of $6.88 billion, which exceeded estimates by a whopping $557 million. A strategic play further buoyed this financial prowess during a 14% plummet in natural gas prices, attributed to sufficient storage and an unexpectedly mild winter. Looking forward, NextEra Energy aims for an adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8% annually through 2026 from 2024 levels. With TipRanks analysts giving NEE stock a ‘moderate buy’ rating and predicting a 25.01% upside potential, the future indeed looks bright for this renewable energy titan. Devon Energy (DVN) Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN ), a leader in hydrocarbon exploration, excels in the upstream energy sector, boasting a five-year dividend growth rate of 21.67% . This demonstrates the company’s durability and potential for future growth. Embracing renewable energy, Devon has invested $10 million in Fervo Energy , a pioneer in geothermal technology, showing its commitment to the renewable sector’s future. Moreover, DVN’s strategy goes beyond mere investments to include bold acquisitions, notably its pursuit of Enerplus Corp . This effort aims to strengthen its oil and gas sector presence, boost its operational capabilities, and diversify its portfolio. Financially, DVN exceeded expectations with an EPS of $1.65 , surpassing forecasts by 10 cents. Despite a YOY revenue drop of 29.3%, the company still managed to outdo revenue expectations by $211 million. This financial prowess, coupled with a ‘moderate buy’ rating from TipRanks analysts and a 31.38% upside potential, positions Devon Energy as a compelling investment choice.

This is no time to go wobbly on American natural gas and oil By Amanda Eversole Facebook Twitter Email Print February 16, 2024 6:00 am Facebook Twitter Email Print The impacts of recent missile attacks by Houthi rebels on container ships in the Red Sea are being felt far beyond the Middle East . Threats to safe passage through the strategic waterway have caused delays and detours, resulting in increased fuel costs and snags in the global supply chain, according to media reports. Thus, it is a bad time for the Biden administration to further weaken global energy security. Recommended Stories Fast-track post-traumatic stress treatments. Our veterans can’t wait A promise to those who served Veterans defended our homeland and now they need a place in it Instead of embracing all forms of American energy as strategic assets and expediting infrastructure projects, the White House is in retreat. In the process, it is signaling to United States friends overseas that America may backtrack on its promises. To paraphrase former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher: With all the ongoing geopolitical chaos, now is no time for America to go wobbly. But that’s what the administration did last month in halting pending and future U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export approvals. In an ideal world, the administration would value the good that America’s natural gas and oil abundance brings in advancing security, stabilizing global markets, and reducing emissions. Instead, the administration has left some allies wondering about the reliability of America’s promises. President Joe Biden pledged to supply Europe with U.S. LNG to fill a supply gap left by nations moving away from Russian piped natural gas. But the need isn’t short-term or otherwise momentary. Europe faces supply questions for the future that America’s LNG could answer. Among other restrictions on U.S. energy leadership, the LNG pause is a win for Russia and an alarming turnabout for U.S. allies. Biden should immediately reverse it and embrace the advantages of being the world’s leading producer of natural gas and oil — the leading producer in all of history. America’s energy advantage is national security that comes from access to abundant energy, which also shields America amid volatility. This advantage wasn’t built overnight. It won’t be sustained without smart policies from Washington. Beyond our shores, we have used the American energy advantage to help our friends, whose security is closely connected to our own. In addition to providing opportunity for other countries to realize reduced emissions that result from switching from coal to cleaner natural gas, America’s energy advantage means our allies do not have to turn to unstable governments and state-owned sources to keep the lights on. Examples abound in recent history. In 2022, America’s LNG producers helped Europe avert the worst of an energy crisis that followed Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing turmoil. And 50 years ago, the U.S. learned the meaning of energy security — or lack thereof — during the 1973 oil embargo. Secretary of State Antony Blinken even admitted that “we’ve not seen a situation as dangerous as the one we’re facing now across the [Middle East] since at least 1973.” Let’s act to spare the U.S. and our allies from that era of energy insecurity. Looking ahead, it is reasonable to assume that some countries will remain eager to weaponize energy. To insulate ourselves and our allies, America’s energy leadership should include all energy sources – traditional and new. But the White House’s current over-reliance on still-maturing energy sources, while abandoning proven ones, will not strengthen our energy advantage or global energy security. Instead, we risk increasing our reliance — and that of the world’s — on Chinese-controlled manufacturing and critical mineral supplies. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM RESTORING AMERICA With the global population expected to grow 20% by 2050, we need more energy sources, not less — specifically, more oil and natural gas, which provided 70% of America’s energy in 2022. We will also need more wind, more solar, and more modern infrastructure to support them all. If it’s energy made in America it keeps the lights on, and it’s produced safer and cleaner, Washington should support it—because it bolsters both U.S. and worldwide energy security. Diplomatic alarm bells are ringing. Conflicts are brewing in strategic hotspots worldwide. If the White House’s vision is restricting the use of our natural resources, then the question here and around the world is direct: If not America’s energy, then whose? The answer could have grave consequences for ourselves and our friends. Amanda Eversole is executive vice president and chief advocacy officer at the American Petroleum Institute.

Advertisement Good news as energy bills are set to fall to to their lowest level in TWO YEARS - but will still cost the average home £1,635 The Ofgem price cap is likely to fall by £293 a year in April, Cornwall Insight says Although any drop in energy bills is welcome, prices far outstrip pre-2021 levels By SAM BARKER, ASSISTANT PERSONAL FINANCE EDITOR FOR THIS IS MONEY Updated: 07:17 EST, 16 February 2024 e-mail 39 View comments Energy bills will fall in April, experts think - but only by 15 per cent, or £293, to £1,635 a year. The average home currently pays £1,928 a year for gas and electricity bills as they are on a tariff regulated by the Ofgem price cap, which is set four times a year. But expert energy analysts at Cornwall Insight believe the price cap will fall to £1,635 a year from 1 April. That rate applies to a home with average energy use, on a variable-rate energy tariff and paying by direct debit. The current price cap sets the energy bills paid by more than 80 per cent of UK homes, though the exact amount varies depending on gas and electricity use. Feed the meter: Energy bills have been high since late 2021, when prices began to skyrocket The price cap is then reset in July and once again in October. Cornwall Insight thinks the average gas and electricity bill will fall again to £1,465.07 in July, before rising to £1,523.95 in October.

Share this article Share HOW THIS IS MONEY CAN HELP Economy 7 customers now WON'T lose cheap off-peak energy in March as firms extend deadline Cornwall Insight principal consultant Craig Lowery said: ' Forecasts show energy bills returning to their lowest levels in over two years, providing a much-needed respite for a nation struggling with a cost of living crisis. 'Fairly healthy gas supply across the Atlantic, coupled with high storage levels in Europe, are helping to keep bills down. But we mustn’t get too complacent. Our energy system is still walking a tightrope, and we cannot be sure another political or economic crisis won’t send bills straight back up. 'Even with the drop, prices will remain a struggle for many. We need to remember, bills remain hundreds of pounds above pre-pandemic levels, and if we don't speed up the switch to sustainable energy and cut down on volatile imports, they are likely to stay that way.' When will cheap fixed energy deals come back? A big question for consumers is whether lower, more stable energy bills could encourage energy firms to bring back cheap fixed-rate deals. Fixed-rate tariffs have historically been far cheaper than variable rates, but dried up once energy prices began soaring in late 2021. While energy companies have started relaunching fixed rate energy deals , many are more expensive than staying on the price cap, or only available to existing customers. Uswitch director of regulation Richard Neudegg said: 'Prices are forecast to fall again in July, but the market remains unpredictable, and it is hard to know how energy rates will look when usage climbs again in winter. 'With more than just a glimmer of hope on the horizon for wholesale energy costs, all eyes are now on suppliers to see how they will price their other deals. 'Consumers have waited long enough for better tariff choices, and desperately need the opportunity to take advantage of cheaper rates.' Tempted to fix? What to consider... With more energy suppliers now offering fixed energy tariffs, many households might be considering signing up to one once again, writes Sam Barker. Before taking the plunge, it is vital to consider these four steps: 1. Make sure the deal is a good one To work out if an energy deal - fixed or otherwise - is cheaper than you are paying now, compare the unit rate and standing charge with what you currently pay. There are several fixed rate energy deals that are more expensive than staying on the Ofgem price cap. The average home is paying rates limited by this price cap, which means 53p a day in electricity standing charges and 30p for gas, while electricity unit rates are 29p per kilowatt-hour (kWh) and 7p/kWh for gas. The massive variable is what happens with the Ofgem price cap in the future. It might be possible to lock into a cheaper deal now, only to see the price cap fall significantly, leaving you overpaying. 2. Remember to check the exit fees Many fixed-rate energy deals come with steep exit fees, which you will pay if you try to leave the deal early. These can be as high as £150 each for gas and electricity. 3. Check your emails At the moment there are very few fixed-rate energy deals on the open market. But many energy firms do have some fixes only open to their existing customers. They advertise these by emailing their customers, so remember to check all emails from your energy firm.

Cooke Facebook Twitter Email Print February 16, 2024 6:00 am Facebook Twitter Email Print The 1970s called — it wants its elitist energy policy and depressingly pessimistic narrative back. We should happily oblige and move toward a more optimistic, more realistic narrative of abundance and innovation supported by public policy. Deprivation and crisis marked U.S. energy policy in the 1970s. Too reliant upon unfriendly regimes, the Arab oil embargo caused fuel shortages, skyrocketing gas prices, and long lines at the gas pump. President Gerald Ford told the public to “drive less, heat less.” President Jimmy Carter , who put solar panels on the White House , then warned of a pending “national catastrophe” unless the public curbed its energy consumption. Recommended Stories Fast-track post-traumatic stress treatments. Our veterans can’t wait A promise to those who served Veterans defended our homeland and now they need a place in it Their words fit neatly with environmental elitists such as scientists Paul Ehrlich and Amory Lovins, who believed the problem was a society with access to “cheap, abundant energy.” They were particularly worried about the peaceful usage of nuclear power. “It’d be little short of disastrous for us to discover a source of cheap, clean, and abundant energy because of what we would do with it,” Lovins said in 1977, referring to nuclear energy. Nearly five decades later, the “consume less” narrative is being implemented through energy efficiency programs for everything from lightbulbs to leaf blowers, bans on natural gas appliances, fuel standards for cars, and mandates to electrify transportation. At the same time, energy efficiency advocates, such as Lovins, are championing less efficient, intermittent sources such as wind and solar to power our grid, thereby forcing energy scarcity upon us. We should challenge the energy deprivation narrative. The public is fortunate to live in a country that is resource-rich and diverse, where coal, natural gas, and oil can be responsibly developed and new technology is encouraged. Three uranium mines opened late last year. And the Fervo-Google project in Nevada demonstrates the promise of geothermal. In a 2022 paper, energy optimists Austin Vernon and Eli Dourado from the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University dared to ask, “What would it be like if we were able to consume vastly more energy?” Coining the phrase “energy superabundance,” they explored the idea that energy policy should focus on being clean, cheap, and plentiful rather than restricted, unreliable, and expensive. They encourage looking at resources through the lens of their potential rather than simply emissions. The optimism of their premise is attractive. U.S. energy production has tripled since 1950, as reported by the Energy Information Association. In the second week of December 2023, the United States set a production record of 13.3 million barrels of oil per day despite a 69% decline in oil rigs. The country is well positioned to stake its flag in energy dominance on the global stage. At the same time, we’ve cleaned up the planet, too. The Environmental Protection Agency reports that between “1970 and 2020, the combined emissions of the six common pollutants dropped by 78%.” In addition, we’ve cleaned up our waterways. The bottom line is we’ve become great stewards of our environment. What should we do to benefit from energy abundance? First, dump the energy poverty mindset. Energy usage, educational attainment, and economic prosperity go together. We should instead develop a reality-based mindset that we can develop our natural resources responsibly, enjoy a clean environment, and benefit from a healthy, thriving economy that relies upon clean, affordable, reliable, abundant energy. Second, the government should get out of the way and let the markets work. The government is lousy at picking winners and losers, usually influenced by political motives rather than scientific principles. Stop using public funds to support costly, unreliable, and weather-contingent energy sources that squander financial resources and destabilize the power grid. Similarly, taxpayer money should not be used to back products such as electric vehicles that lack consumer demand. Lastly, we must educe green tape and unleash innovation. Today, environmental concerns are used to delay or halt necessary generation and production projects for sources that work. The Keystone Pipeline and the recent “pause” on approvals of much-needed liquefied natural gas exports are recent examples. We’ve proven we can develop resources responsibly and be good environmental stewards. We need regulatory reform and the streamlining of our permitting process to reflect that reality, especially for clean, reliable nuclear energy. Energy is our economic paradigm. It’s in everything. To ensure our children and grandchildren enjoy a higher standard of living and a clean environment, we need to embrace energy abundance so that energy costs are lower, innovation is rewarded, and consumption isn’t demonized. Otherwise, they’ll be destined to relive the 1970s. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM RESTORING AMERICA Amy O. Cooke is a visiting energy policy fellow at State Policy Network.

Emily Beament Updated 15 February 2024 at 10:10 am 10 Copied Some 3.17 million low income households were struggling to pay their energy bills to heat draughty homes in 2023, official figures show. In England, official statistics consider a household to be in fuel poverty if their home has a poor energy efficiency rating of band D or below and their disposable income after housing and fuel costs is below the poverty line. The data from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero shows 13% of households in England were in fuel poverty last year, largely unchanged from 13.1% in 2022. The figure would have been more than 3.5 million households in fuel poverty without Government support including energy bill payments and the cost-of-living income payments given to people on low incomes, the data showed. The data also reveals well over a third of households (36.4%) or some 8.91 million were forced to spend more than 10% of their income, after housing costs, on domestic energy bills, up from 6.66 million in 2022. Due to energy improvements there has been a slight increase in the proportion of low income households living in a property with a fuel poverty energy efficiency rating of Band C or higher, pulling them out of fuel poverty according to the statistics. Some 54% of all low income households live in a property with an energy rating of C or above, up from 53.1% in 2022, the figures show. The fuel poverty gap – the reduction in fuel costs needed for a household not to be in fuel poverty – jumped in 2023 to £417, from £348 the year before. Simon Francis, co-ordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said the figures do not paint the “true picture of suffering” as they exclude millions of homes in certain energy performance categories and many people who receive a Warm Home Discount for their bills. He added: “The numbers of households paying more than 10% of their income on energy is truly shocking, far exceeding previous estimates. “The reality is that household energy debt is now at record levels, millions of people are living in cold, damp homes and children are suffering in mouldy conditions. “The wider impact of high energy bills is also clear to see with households having to cut back on spending so much that the UK has now entered a recession.” Greenpeace UK climate campaigner Georgia Whitaker said: “Progress on tackling fuel poverty is flatlining, despite the ongoing energy crisis, which has forced those on the lowest incomes to freeze in their own homes. “The cheapest and most effective way to help is to insulate homes, but Government funding for energy efficiency schemes was pushed off a cliff edge by ministers over a decade ago.” She criticised moves to remove the legal requirement on private landlords to insulate homes, and urged Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to “drop his anti-green agenda” as measures – such as insulation – to tackle the climate crisis also ease the cost of living. A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: “We’re providing an average of £3,700 per household to help with bills, and the latest figures show that our energy bill support schemes and progress in making homes more energy efficient have protected hundreds of thousands of households from fuel poverty. “We’ve halved inflation, and energy prices are now significantly lower than their peak last year – but we recognise the cost-of-living challenges that families are still facing and will continue to target support at those most in need.”

Moneycontrol News February 15, 2024 / 14:15 IST The IREDA head said India’s energy demand would increase significantly. India's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), or its self-defined climate pledges under the Paris Agreement, for 2030 would require Rs 30 lakh crore of investments, said Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA) Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) Pradip Kumar. The investment is required in manufacturing and capacity build-up for solar power, electrolysers, wind and battery space, power transmission, green hydrogen, hydro power and waste-to-energy sectors, he said at an international webinar organised by the World Bank on February 15.

Until sufficient energy storage for renewable energy is achieved, thermal energy will also be developed alongside,” Kumar said. He hailed the government for taking a host of initiatives in the renewable space that have helped India become a role model for renewable energy development worldwide.

ADHD News & Research Energy Drink Consumption Linked to ADHD, Depression, Risky Behavior: Study Children and adolescents who drink energy drinks may be more likely than their peers to have ADHD, mental health issues, sleep issues, and suicidal ideation, a new U.K. study finds. By Melanie Wolkoff Wachsman Updated on February 14, 2024 Click to Add Comments Print Facebook Twitter Instagram Pinterest February 13, 2024 Energy drink consumption is associated with an elevated risk for physical and mental health conditions such as ADHD, depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation among children and adolescents, according to a new study published in the journal Public Health . 1 The study’s U.K. research team linked energy drink consumption with a higher-than-average risk of poor academic performance, sleep problems, unhealthy dietary habits, and risky behaviors. Children and teens who consumed energy drinks were more likely than non-drinkers to engage in unsafe sex and vehicle use, binge drinking, vaping, violent behaviors, and alcohol and substance use. Energy drink consumption was also tied to increased ADHD inattention , conduct disorder, and depressive and panic symptoms. The rates of suicidal ideation and attempts increased among those who drank more than one energy drink a day compared to non-drinkers. 1 The systematic review examined 57 studies about the effects of energy drinks on children and young people up to age 21 from January 2016 to July 2022. The data came from more than 20 countries and involved more than 1.2 million children and young adults. (The review did not include the brands of energy drinks consumed.) The report confirmed findings from a similar review in 2016 conducted by the same research team. 2 What Are Energy Drinks? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines an energy drink as “a beverage that typically contains large amounts of caffeine, added sugars, other additives, and legal stimulants such as guarana, taurine, and L-carnitine. Energy drinks are marketed as providing mental and physical stimulation; they contain no nutritional value. The amount of caffeine in energy drinks typically exceeds adults’ daily recommended doses. Data from the Center for Science in the Public Interest shows that energy drinks may contain as little as 75mg of caffeine — slightly less than one average cup of coffee — or up to 316mg per 8 ounces, the equivalent of more than three cups. Energy drinks have exploded in popularity in recent years, particularly among teens. A 2013 study of 37,500 children and adolescents in 16 European countries found that 18% of children (3–10 years) and 68% of adolescents (10–18 years) consumed energy drinks in the previous year.8 Between 12% and 35% of children and young adults consume them at least once per week. 3 The U.K. study found that male teens consume more energy drinks than do females. Taste and energy-seeking were the main drivers of energy drink use. The study also reported that children and teens may turn to energy drinks as a coping mechanism, out of social acceptance, or to enhance performance on tests and in sports. Energy Drink Consumption Among Kids with ADHD Nearly 5% of ADDitude Reader Panel members say their children consume energy drinks every day or regularly, according to a recent survey. “My children like to drink Prime because they think it’s cool, and they like the taste,” one reader said. “My daughter tries out the latest fads with energy drinks,” said another reader. “I worry about her caffeine consumption. I keep teaching her to watch the caffeine content and to be careful about how much she drinks. I don’t see her drink them — I just see empty containers in her car — so I can’t say what the effect is on her ADHD symptoms.” Another reader shared that her daughter (now 21) “has used Red Bull daily since high school. She is currently unmedicated (Her choice, not mine.) I believe it helps her focus a little.” An additional 12% of ADDitude Reader Panelists said their children occasionally consume energy drinks. “My teen kids will have an energy drink (Yerba Mate or Celsius) now and then for sports or athletic activities like between soccer games on tournament weekends or when skiing,” a reader said. “It adds to their energy, which is fine when engaging in physically demanding activities. I would not allow it before school as it likely would create jitteriness if they had to sit for hours.” “My child occasionally swipes a sip of his dad’s Red Bull,” said another reader. “Other than that, he doesn’t drink them. We mostly avoid energy drinks because of the additional additives in them.” Less than half (44%) of reader panelists said their children are prohibited from consuming energy drinks. “I am fearful of the jittery anxiety it seems to produce,” one reader said. “The [energy drink] crash has caused my son to melt down and become horribly embarrassed when in public.” “I do not want myself or my children to have energy drinks because they are high in sugar and caffeine,” another reader said. “We have diabetes and heart disease in our family, and we do not need to add on to that.” Other readers offer energy drink alternatives. “We don’t allow our kids to have energy drinks as they contain harmful ingredients,” the reader said. “We have allowed our kids to try coffee. They don’t care for the taste, but it did help my son to be less crabby in the morning.” “There’s too much empty sugar and caffeine in them,” another reader said. “As a special treat, my teens with ADHD buy themselves sweet drinks at Starbucks. I encourage caffeine-free drinks. The body is hard enough to understand and regulate without all the added effects of sugar and caffeine.” Energy Drinks: Next Steps The observational study could not prove causality between energy drink consumption and poor health outcomes; the drinks could, for example, be more popular among adolescents with naturally low levels of dopamine and/or those facing higher risks of mental and physical health issues. However, the researchers said their findings were strong enough to suggest policymakers consider banning the sales of these products to children. “We have raised concerns about the health impacts of these drinks for the best part of a decade after finding that they were sold to children as young as 10 years old [for less] than bottled water,” lead author Amelia Lake, Ph.D., a professor of public health nutrition from Fuse, the Centre for Translational Research in Public Health at Teesside University in England, said in a press release . “The evidence is clear that energy drinks are harmful to the mental and physical health of children and young people as well as their behavior and education. We need to act now to protect them from these risks.” The American Academy of Pediatrics states that caffeine and other stimulant substances contained in energy drinks have no place in the diet of children and adolescents. 4 Keeping Energy Drinks Out of Children’s Hands — and Mouths The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offered the following tips for caregivers and educators: Teachers and other school staff can educate students about the danger of consuming too much caffeine, including energy drinks. Coaches can educate athletes about the difference between energy and sports drinks and the potential dangers of consuming highly caffeinated beverages. School nutrition staff can provide only healthy beverages such as fat-free/low-fat milk, water, and 100% juice in the cafeteria. Parents, school staff, and community members can join the school or district wellness committee that sets the policies for health and wellness and establish or revise nutrition standards to address the sale and marketing of energy drinks in school settings. Adults can model good behavior by not consuming energy drinks in front of kids. View Article Sources 1 Ajibo, C., Van Griethuysen, A., Visram, S., Lake, A. A. (2024).

Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian View image in fullscreen Common Wealth said state-led investment in clean energy would save households money on their bills. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian This article is more than 1 year old Labour urged to double funding in publicly owned renewables This article is more than 1 year old Cash injection in Great British Energy should be increased to £30bn, thinktank says after Keir Starmer U-turn Keir Starmer is being urged to more than double Labour’s investment in publicly owned renewable energy to save consumers billions of pounds on their bills, despite the party drastically scaling back its plans last week. In an intervention after the Labour leader scrapped the party’s £28bn green investment pledge in the most controversial U-turn of his leadership, the Common Wealth thinktank said a step-change in government backing for clean energy generation was still required. It said plans to retain an initial cash injection in Great British Energy – a state-owned renewable power generation company planned if Labour is elected to power – was an important “down payment”, but should be increased to £30bn over the course of a first term in office. There have been growing questions over Labour’s target to decarbonise the UK’s electricity system by 2030 after it slashed the funding package behind its green economy plans by half. As a key group influencing Ed Miliband, the shadow net zero secretary, Common Wealth was the first thinktank to promote a new publicly owned energy generator – providing backing for GB Energy – based on similar European firms such as Sweden’s Vattenfall, Denmark’s Ørsted and Norway’s Equinor. Miliband is understood to have pushed back against the dilution of Labour’s £28bn investment plan, with speculation – denied by his team – that he could resign over the issue. However, in a sign of unity, he contributed a quote to the press release confirming it would be scaled back. Labour has said GB Energy would be headquartered in Scotland as a “homegrown, publicly owned champion in clean energy generation” to enable the creation of jobs and manufacturing in Britain’s renewables sector. However, several details remain unclear , including whether it would operate green assets directly or control a portfolio of investments in other companies instead. Labour said last week that GB Energy would “partner with industry” and “co-invest” in groundbreaking green technologies such as floating offshore wind, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and tidal stream energy. It has also suggested the party would help capital-intensive projects such as the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk with “backing and building”. The government is, however, seeking significantly more investment for the project than Labour currently plans for GB Energy, with ministers looking to raise £20bn from outside investors after removing the Chinese state-owned group CGN in 2022 over security concerns. In a report setting out the case for a vast expansion of GB Energy in the early years of a Labour government, Common Wealth said state-led investment in clean energy would be substantially cheaper than the private sector equivalent – helping to save households money on their bills. It said renewable investment financed out of Labour’s initial £8.3bn capitalisation would save between £125m and £208m a year on debt interest costs each year – saving up to £1bn in total compared with private-sector borrowing, which is typically more expensive. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion Analysis in the report was based on estimates from the International Energy Association that a 2 percentage point increase in borrowing costs can lead to a 20% increase in a solar or wind project’s “levelised cost of electricity”, a measure of the average cost of each unit of electricity generated over the lifetime of an asset. Common Wealth said this was a good proxy for the savings between government-backed investment and the private sector, which could be passed on to households in the form of cheaper bills. Mathew Lawrence, Common Wealth’s director, said: “Keir Starmer’s renewed commitment to GB Energy, Labour’s proposed new public renewables company, is welcome. However, the true test of ambition is in its design and scale. “An ambitious public renewables company like GB Energy on the scale of leading international equivalents would mean lower energy bills, good jobs in every part of the country, faster decarbonisation and energy independence for the UK - indeed it is the cornerstone of any serious attempt to transition our economy.” A Labour spokesperson said: “With Labour’s ambitious £8.3bn capitalisation of Great British Energy, we will invest in clean homegrown power that will cut energy bills, create the next generation of jobs in clean industries, and make Britain energy independent.” Explore more on these topics Energy industry Labour Keir Starmer Energy efficiency Renewable energy Energy Green politics news Share Reuse this content

Published on East Asia & Pacific on the Rise Increasing energy efficiency in industry: What can emerging economies learn from the Republic of Korea? Anwar Aridi Nah-Yoon Shin Joo Sueb Lee February 13, 2024 This page in: English English English © syeols/ Shutterstock A growing number of middle-income countries are committing to net zero emissions and pledging to decouple their emissions from growth. But energy consumption, especially in emerging economies, is increasing, and the industrial sector is a leading consumer, accounting for roughly 24 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. The share of industrial emissions is especially large in many large emerging economies—including China, Viet Nam, Türkiye, Thailand, Malaysia, and Bangladesh —where the manufacturing sector accounts for more than 20 percent of GDP. Given this high level of industrial emissions, how realistic are these pledges? How can emerging economies with large manufacturing sectors achieve their net zero objectives? Energy efficiency is the most cost-effective way to meet energy and climate goals. Nevertheless, the ability to improve energy efficiency varies widely across sectors, with the energy intensity of some sectors four times that of others (figure 1). Sectors with very high energy intensity (such as cement, steel and iron, chemicals, food processing, and paper and pulp) are labeled as hard-to-abate sectors. Given these constraints, what can policy makers do? Figure 1. Korea Manufacturing Energy intensity varies widely across sectors Note: TOE = Ton of oil equivalent. KRW = Korean won. Source: Anwar Aridi, Kim Kibum, Joo Sueb Lee, Nah Yoon Shin, and Daein Kang. Lessons from Korea’s Energy Efficiency Policies in the Industrial Sector. Finance, Competitiveness and Innovation Global Practice. Washington, DC: World Bank Group. A new World Bank report— Lessons from Korea’s Energy Efficiency Policies in the Industry Sector —holds lessons for other economies. The Republic of Korea gradually started decoupling GDP growth from carbon emissions in 2009 (figure 2). The energy intensity of the manufacturing sector decreased by 44% between 2000 and 2020 , but the pace of improvement has decelerated since the 2010s. Despite these improvements, emissions from hard-to-abate sectors remained high, accounting for 75 percent of Korea’s total carbon emissions and 60 percent of national energy consumption . These structural characteristics of Korea’s economy and the limitations they impose make the country a relevant case for industrializing economies of today. Figure 2. GDP growth in the Republic of Korea has far outpaced greenhouse gas emissions Note: GDP = gross domestic product; CO2 = carbon dioxide. Source: Hoon Sahib Soh, Koh, Youngsun, and Anwar Aridi, eds. 2023. Innovative Korea: Leveraging Innovation and Technology for Development. Washington, DC: World Bank. Korea has over 40 years of experience in developing energy efficiency policies, which it began adopting after the oil shock of the 1970s. In 1979, it enacted the Energy Rationalization Use Act. Over the next 30 years, it adopted six five-year Basic Plans for the Rationalization of Energy Use. It gradually developed its energy efficiency policy mix targeting two main objectives: improving the flow of data and inducing firms to adopt energy-efficient solutions. Today, its policy mix includes a combination of mandatory approaches, such as energy efficiency standards and labeling programs and energy audit requirements for energy-intensive firms, and market-based approaches, such as emission trading schemes (ETS). The new report reviewed 17 energy efficiency policy instruments, drawing lessons from Korea's policy experience that could inform the design and implementation of energy efficiency policy in emerging economies. Three main lessons emerge: Incorporate energy intensity implications into industrial policy and economic plans, in order to avoid developing captive economic structures that constrain energy efficiency gains in the long run. K orea’s experience shows that without changing the industrial structure, the characteristics of hard-to-abate sectors make it difficult to achieve additional efficiency gains. Industrial policies and economic plans could take into consideration the energy-intensity implications of targeted industries and steer firms away from hard-to-abate toward greener sectors. Establish effective monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems, and leverage digital technologies to collect, analyze, and monitor energy data. Information asymmetry is one of the key challenges facing the adoption of energy efficiency solutions. Korea was an early promoter and adopter of smart metering, advanced sensors, and energy management systems, through which it collects data on consumption and emission and shares them two main public databases, the Korea Energy Statistical Information System (KESIS) and the National Greenhouse Gas Emission Total Information System (NETIS). Develop implementing agencies with the capabilities to design and implement a comprehensive energy efficiency policy mix. The Korea Energy Agency (KEA), the de facto implementer of energy efficiency policy in Korea, was given a clear mandate to communicate realistic targets; issue technical guidelines, methodologies, and metrics; and regularly consult with industries to reduce the uncertainties associated with sudden policy changes. If emerging economies are to achieve their net zero objectives, they need to integrate industrial energy efficiency into their policy objectives. They can learn from and avoid the mistakes of yesterday’s emerging economies by choosing green pathways rather than falling into traps encountered by the forerunners.

The urgent need for American energy leadership By Tim Tarpley | Rep. Troy Balderson Facebook Twitter Email Print February 13, 2024 10:07 am Facebook Twitter Email Print The COVID-19 pandemic showed us too much of the global supply chain runs through Communist China . Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s illegal invasion of Ukraine showed us too many of our European allies rely on Russian energy. Time after time, global crises serve as stark reminders that relying on hostile actors for critical resources is a recipe for disaster. For example, countries such as Germany have allowed their energy security to slip away and are now paying the price, powerless to decide their own future. Recommended Stories Trump has an opportunity to protect Syria’s ancient communities Trump will soon see that democracy promotion matters Europe’s due diligence rule is a risk for US manufacturers Since the outbreak of war in Ukraine, Germany and much of the rest of Europe have become dependent on the United States’s growing natural gas industry. Nations whose energy mix relied on Russian exports raced to divest from the Putin war machine, and President Joe Biden vowed to make sure we could provide them with what they needed. This makes the Biden administration’s most recent decision to halt new liquefied natural gas exports even more perplexing and dangerous. It is critical for the administration to change course, drop the hostile rhetoric toward domestic energy production, and embrace American energy dominance. The U.S. is blessed with abundant, reliable energy sources — enough to fuel domestic demand while also providing nations across the globe with clean, reliable energy. Domestically produced natural gas has become a cornerstone of America’s energy mix, creating thousands of high-paying jobs and helping curtail greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, according to the Energy Information Administration, the U.S. reduced emissions by more than 20% from 2005 to 2020, more than nearly any other nation in the world, while almost doubling our natural gas production. The impact in Ohio alone is remarkable. Natural gas has helped reduce carbon emissions from power generation by an astounding 38%, and a recent study found that the oil and gas industry contributed more than $55 billion to the Ohio economy in 2021. Pursuing an “all of the above approach” to energy consumption and using all available energy sources just makes sense. We must take every opportunity to reduce our dependence on foreign energy sources and reduce our vulnerability to global supply chain disruptions. It’s not enough for us simply to meet energy demands. We need to be capable of providing energy that is both reliable and affordable. According to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s most recent long-term reliability outlook, power demand in North America is growing at the fastest rate in 30 years. Over the next decade, peak summer demand will rise by over 79 gigawatts, while peak winter demand will increase by nearly 91 gigawatts. At the same time, an estimated 83 gigawatts of fossil fuels and nuclear power plants are expected to retire. To keep the lights on and avoid severe power disruptions in the future, we cannot allow policies that will force existing reliable generation into early retirement. Unfortunately, the Biden administration is actively working to add barriers to natural gas production and exportation. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER So, what must be done? First, as mentioned above, the Biden administration needs to reverse its dangerous decision to halt future LNG export projects. Second, the administration must withdraw its new methane regulations targeting American energy production and small natural gas producers. Third, Congress needs to act quickly on permitting reform, allowing for the construction of new energy infrastructure and reliable transportation of natural gas and other energy to all corners of our country from the basins where it is produced. And fourth, we need to make the necessary regulatory and policy changes to allow for a reliable electric grid to flourish, and the government should encourage natural gas-fired power generation to be a large part of this new reliable grid. Investing in American natural gas is essential for achieving energy security and severing dependence on hostile nations, and it is key for promoting economic growth and job creation. The future of American energy is right below our feet, and it’s time for our energy policy to reflect that fact. Rep. Troy Balderson has served Ohio’s 12th Congressional District since 2018. Tim Tarpley is president of the Energy Workforce & Technology Council, the national trade association for the global energy technology and services sector, representing more than 665,000 U.S. jobs in the technology-driven energy value chain.

Title: Biden puts $60M into three geothermal energy projects

The Biden administration is putting $60 million into three geothermal energy pilot projects, it announced Tuesday. Geothermal energy is energy from the heat of the earth that is trapped underground in hot water reservoirs. This type of energy is carbon-free and does not emit greenhouse gases. It can be used to generate electricity and also to heat buildings. The funds, from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, will fund three projects that aim to demonstrate that geothermal energy that comes from man-made reservoirs is effective and able to be used on a large scale. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The projects receiving federal funds are a Chevron New Energies project in California, a Fervo Energy project in Utah and a Mazama Energy project in Oregon. An Energy Department analysis found last year that the U.S. could get enough geothermal energy onto the grid to power 65 million homes in 2050. “These projects will help us advance geothermal power, including into regions of the country where this renewable resource has never before been used,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a written statement. She added that the pilot projects “will help us realize the full potential of the heat beneath our feet to reduce carbon emissions, create domestic jobs, and deliver clean, cost-effective, reliable energy.” For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.

Skip Navigation Markets Business Investing Tech Politics Video Watchlist Investing Club PRO Livestream Menu Key Points Saudi state-controlled Aramco suspended its capacity expansion plans because of the green transition, Saudi energy minister Abdulaziz bin Salman said Monday. "I think we postponed this [Aramco capacity] investment simply because … we're transitioning. And transitioning means that even our oil company, which used to be an oil company, became a hydrocarbon company. Now it's becoming an energy company," the Saudi minister said. "Energy security in the 70s, and 80s and 90s was more dependent on oil. Now, you get what happened last year … It was gas. The future problem on energy security, it will not be oil. It will be renewables. And the materials, and the mines," he stressed. Saudi energy minister Abdulaziz bin Salman on Oct. 5, 2022. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images Saudi's state-controlled oil giant Aramco suspended its capacity expansion plans because of the green transition, Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman said Monday, stressing that the future of energy security lies with renewables. "I think we postponed this [Aramco capacity] investment simply because … we're transitioning. And transitioning means that even our oil company, which used to be an oil company, became a hydrocarbon company. Now it's becoming an energy company," the Saudi prince said during a question and answer panel at the International Petroleum Technology Conference in Dhahran, noting that Aramco has investments in oil, gas, petrochemicals and renewables. On Jan. 30, the Saudi energy ministry surprised the markets with a directive instructing the Saudi majority-owned Aramco, which went public in 2019, to stop plans to increase its maximum crude production capacity from 12 million barrels per day to 13 million barrels per day by 2027. The ministry did not disclose the reason behind its decision at the time, sparking questions over potential Saudi concerns over the future of oil demand amid a progressing energy transition. The Saudi energy minister on Monday qualified the decision was not made hastily and was the product of a continuous review of market conditions. "We are in [a] continuous mode of reviewing and reviewing and reviewing, simply because you have to view the realities [of the market]," he said. watch now VIDEO 3:05 03:05 Saudi Arabia's directive for Aramco was 'prudent,' oil and gas consultancy says Capital Connection Oil prices have spasmed through waves of volatility in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, weighed by lower-than-expected recoveries in Chinese demand and inflationary pressures. The global movement to decarbonize and stave off a climate crisis has redirected energy companies away from long-term fossil fuel projects in favor of greener investment pastures — and may redefine the outlook for energy security, Abdulaziz bin Salman signaled on Monday. "Energy security in the 70s, and 80s and 90s was more dependent on oil. Now, you get what happened last year … It was gas. The future problem on energy security, it will not be oil. It will be renewables. And the materials, and the mines," he stressed, noting that there is still a "huge cushion" of spare capacity available in the event of an emergency shortage. Previously, such supply shocks have struck by way of sanctions or attacks against oil infrastructure worldwide. "Why should we be the last country to hold energy capacity, or emergency capacity, when it is not appreciated? And when it is not recognized?" the Saudi energy minister said. "Energy security is not just the responsibility of Saudi Arabia. It's the responsibility of all energy producers and energy ministries," Notably, spare capacity has also long served as a diplomatic instrument in the Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, shaping the odds of victory in the fleeting one-month price war between Riyadh and Moscow in 2020. Saudi Arabia and its OPEC allies have long championed a combined energy transition strategy that utilizes fossil fuel resources until such a time that renewable supplies are available to fully cover global requirements, downplaying concerns over markets imminently hitting peak old demand. The stance stands in staunch contrast to that of the International Energy Agency, which in a landmark report of 2021 advocated against further investment in new fossil fuel supply projects, if humanity is to combat the climate crisis. Yet Middle East countries have increasingly attempted to reconcile their image as stalwart fossil fuel producers with their energy transition ambitions, with key OPEC producer the United Arab Emirates hosting last year's U.N. climate-geared Conference of the Parties (COP). The world's largest crude exporter, Saudi Arabia aims to decarbonize by 2060, with Saudi Aramco targeting to reach operational net-zero emissions by 2050. Steered by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 plan, the kingdom has also been grappling with diversifying its economy away from overreliance on fossil fuels.

And while energy consumers are more interested than ever in sustainability and the potential of a clean energy future, 70% say they won't spend more time or money to take action. Consumer fatigue is setting in, stalling confidence, and stagnating progress says EY in the 'Energy transition consumer insights' report. Greg Guthridge, EY Global Energy & Resources Customer Experience Transformation Leader, says: "Consumer apprehension comes as we enter a new - more difficult - phase of the energy transition, all while dealing with higher energy prices, geopolitical volatility, and growing concerns around energy equity. While efforts on the supply side are gaining momentum, we need an even more fundamental shift in how we engage and encourage sustainable consumer behavior. Energy consumers want a clean energy future but need a broad range of support to make personal energy choices. Closing the gap between their interest and action will depend on energy providers, government, and the broader energy ecosystem working together to pull every lever available." Consumers lose faith in the "three As" of energy Over three years, EY surveyed nearly 100,000 residential energy consumers across 21 markets, with the latest insight revealing consumers are less confident in their energy future than they were a year ago. Many say the energy system just isn't delivering on the three fundamental aspects of the energy experience: affordability, access, and appeal. Only 30% of consumers are confident that their energy will remain affordable and 72% state they can't absorb a bill increase of 10%. Moreover, while 26% of consumers have a good understanding of terms such as renewable energy and sustainability, this figure has not improved over the last three years. The findings also show that consumers are diverse - and often irrational - being driven by a wide range of energy values. Creating 'appeal' means understanding the complicated drivers of human behavior. Of those surveyed, 77% want their energy provider to offer low-cost energy options alongside high-end products and services. Additionally, 67% seek personalized energy solutions and 18% of consumers would adopt new energy products and services if it was easier to purchase and install them. Guthridge says: "Change is accelerating exponentially across the world's multiple energy transitions. Disruption to the energy industry is increasing. And at the heart of this is the consumer. The EY research shows consumers are interested about the potential of change but want partners to help." "This creates an opportunity for energy providers to reshape themselves as trusted advisors -making change easier, faster, broader, and deeper. A holistic, consumer-centric approach to the energy transition is how we accelerate progress toward a fairer, greener, and better energy system that delivers more value for everyone."

Article Content:
Octopus Energy tariffs, prices, reviews and other information One of the most popular and innovative energy suppliers in the UK, Octopus Energy entered the UK energy market in 2016, using technology to create a leaner business from the ground up and ensure future room to grow. Why choose Octopus Energy? Octopus Energy has grown significantly since its foundation, largely thanks to acquiring the customers of other suppliers that have gone bust, notably Bulb, which had 1.5 million customers when it went into administration, and Shell Energy, which sold its customer base to Octopus when Shell exited the UK retail energy market. Octopus is now the biggest energy supplier in the UK, supplying 24% of electricity customers and 24.1% of gas customers as of the end of 2024. The supplier has also invested heavily in energy efficiency measures along with green energy and electric vehicle infrastructure, as well as expanding operations outside the UK to places as far away as Texas. Octopus Energy also won top prize in Uswitch's 2025 Energy Awards with its customers voting it the best supplier for Overall Customer Satisfaction. It also won the top prize in the 2024 awards. In 2025, it came top in the Best Customer Service category and shared the top spot for Best Value For Money. Varied range of tariffs Extensive products and services offered outside energy supply Award-winning customer service Commitment to renewable energy supply and generation How do I contact Octopus Energy? Emails and calls to Octopus Energy are answered by UK-based energy specialists, with average call wait times under a minute. Octopus has a wide range of guides and FAQ answers on its site, but in the event that you still need to talk to somebody, you can contact its team using the following methods: Phone: 0808 164 1088 (Monday-Thursday 9am-5pm, Friday 9am-4pm) Email: hello@octopus.energy If you want support for heat pumps, solar panels or EV chargers, you can call 0808 164 1088. You can also use a free SignVideo service with BSL interpreters Monday-Thursday 9am-5pm and Friday 9am-4pm. What tariffs are offered by Octopus Energy? Octopus Energy has a vast range of energy tariffs on offer - at the time of writing, there were 72 available to switch to (across domestic, business, credit and prepayment options). It offers fixed rate and variable tariffs where unit rates are fixed or variable according to the level of the energy price cap. Fixed tariffs are popular with those wanting price certainty over a year or more, while variable tariffs could be the cheapest option for many customers in the wake of the wholesale energy market crisis. Other Octopus Energy tariffs include the Tracker tariff, which is based on the daily wholesale price of energy, and the Agile Octopus tariff, which has half-hourly rates. The Octopus Go Tariff is a time-of-use tariff designed especially for households with an electric vehicle, offering cheaper night rates to help make charging more affordable. Does Octopus charge exit fees? Octopus charges exit fees on business tariffs but doesn’t tend to do so on domestic tariffs. Customers should check whether exit fees apply to their tariff before they sign up. Octopus Energy reviews 2025 Octopus Energy has a TrustPilot score of 4.8 from over 612,000 reviews , as of June 2025. Most reviews are overwhelmingly positive, with 90% of the total reviews rating the supplier at the maximum of five stars. Can I get a smart meter with Octopus? You can get a smart meter with Octopus. They make thousands of appointments available across the country each week, though they may not be in your area immediately. Customers can register their interest and then be notified when appointments are available in their area. Does Octopus Energy offer energy efficiency products? As mentioned above, Octopus offers smart meters but also products like smart meters and heat pumps, along with specific electric vehicle charging tariffs. These can be combined with “smart tariffs” that offer lower energy rates at certain times to help customers use energy more efficiently and bring their bills down. Octopus Energy 2024 customer rating In the 2024 Uswitch Energy Awards , Octopus Energy scooped the Overall Customer Satisfaction prize and came second in the Best Customer Service and Best Value For Money categories. As these awards are voted for by customers, Octopus's successes here reflect the high regard its customers have for it as a supplier. Frequently asked questions Does Octopus offer renewable energy? All Octopus energy tariffs offer 100% renewable electricity, with energy needs met by clean, green sources like solar and wind power. To reduce carbon footprints even further, Octopus can offset the carbon emissions from the gas customers use for a few pounds extra each month. In the last year alone, 26,900 tonnes of CO2 have been saved from entering the atmosphere thanks to customers choosing Octopus’ low-carbon energy over an average standard tariff. That's roughly the same climate impact as planting 365 trees for each and every Octopus Energy customer. Does Octopus Energy have an app? Octopus Energy has an app which acts as a way for customers to manage their energy on the go. Similarly to logging in to an account on a computer, customers are able to see their latest usage and statements, make payments and get help with any problems they're having. Octopus Energy customers have access to an online account, with features from editing Direct Debit amounts and dates, to entering a meter reading, to managing email and account preferences, requesting a credit refund, and booking a smart meter installation. Which providers are similar to Octopus Energy? Octopus’s size and range of tariffs and products offered mean it isn’t really comparable to any other providers. Other members of the big six - British Gas, EDF, E.ON, OVO and ScottishPower - would be the closest alternatives to it. How do I cancel my Octopus Energy supply? If you want to cancel your Octopus Energy supply, you simply need to switch to a new supplier. However, remember that you could end up having to pay exit fees if you’re on a fixed term tariff and haven’t entered the final 49 days of the contract. If you’re on a variable tariff, you’ll be free to switch away at any time. Is Octopus Energy going bust? It’s extremely unlikely that Octopus Energy is going to go bust given its size. However, the energy market remains challenging and unpredictable at the moment, and there is a certain level of risk to some suppliers - find out why in our energy market Q&A guide .

Latest News National Sports World Business Entertainment Royal Videos Hollywood Technology Health Trending Today's Paper Opinion Writer's Archive Magazines TNS Instep Money Matters YOU US Healthcare access By News Desk March 29, 2024 The current healthcare infrastructure in Karachi is inadequate to meet the needs of its growing population. Public hospitals and clinics are often overcrowded and understaffed, leading to long wait times and substandard care. Many people in Karachi cannot afford private healthcare services, further exacerbating the issue of access. The distribution of healthcare facilities across the city is uneven, with certain areas having better access to medical services than others. This disparity in access disproportionately affects marginalized communities, including low-income neighbourhoods and rural areas surrounding the city. To address these challenges, urgent action is needed. There must be increased investment in the healthcare sector to improve infrastructure, hire more healthcare professionals, and ensure the availability of essential medical supplies and equipment. Efforts should be made to enhance the quality of care provided at public healthcare facilities to make them more accessible and reliable for all residents. Initiatives should be launched to expand healthcare coverage and reduce out-of-pocket expenses for patients, particularly for essential services. This could include the introduction of subsidized healthcare programmes or insurance schemes for low-income families.

According to the insurer, more than 40% of this amount has been directed towards safety net hospitals and federally qualified health centers catering to high-risk patients and communities. Change Healthcare, a crucial platform handling approximately 50% of medical claims for nearly 900,000 physicians, 33,000 pharmacies, 5,500 hospitals, and 600 laboratories, fell victim to a cyberattack on February 21 . The attack, attributed to a hacking group identifying itself as “ALPHV” or “BlackCat,” has triggered financial strain among smaller healthcare providers and caused disruptions that UnitedHealth anticipates could take several months to resolve fully. The Department of Health and Human Services is investigating the incident to determine if protected health data was breached. Simultaneously, the State Department has offered rewards of up to $10 million for any information leading to the identification of the hacking group responsible . This significant cyberattack on Change Healthcare has not only impacted the financial stability of numerous healthcare providers but has also raised concerns about data security within the healthcare industry. UnitedHealth’s swift response in providing financial assistance underscores the severity of the situation and the importance of promptly mitigating its repercussions, Reuters noted. In light of this cyber incident, stakeholders across the healthcare sector are reassessing their cybersecurity measures to prevent similar breaches in the future. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the evolving threat landscape facing organizations that handle sensitive data, prompting calls for enhanced cybersecurity protocols and greater collaboration among industry participants. Wednesday, Medical Properties Trust Inc’s (NYSE: MPW ) tenant Steward Health Care entered a deal to sell its nationwide physician network to UnitedHealth’s Optum Care unit .

BOSTON (AP) — Financially embattled hospital operator Steward Health Care has struck a deal to sell its nationwide physician network to Optum, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, as it works to stabilize its finances. The move comes as Gov. Maura Healey has said state monitors are keeping eye on the nine health care facilities operated by Steward Health Care in Massachusetts, including hospitals in some of the state’s poorer communities. The Dallas-based company operates more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Before the sale can be completed, the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission must review the proposal. Steward to close an ‘essential’ Stoughton hospital in April Mass. hospital owner did not release financial docs to comply with Healey’s deadline, governor’s office says Healey: Steward needs to release financial docs and leave Massachusetts The commission doesn’t have the authority to block a transaction but can refer findings to the state Attorney General’s office, the Department of Public Health, or other Massachusetts agencies for possible further action. Advertisement: The documents filed with the state did not include a cost for the transaction. Under the deal, Optum would aquire a Steward affiliate that includes the company’s primary care doctors and other clinicians in nine states. Health Policy Commission Executive Director David Seltz said the panel is committed to a “rigorous, data-driven oversight of health care market changes to bring important information to the public.” He said details of the proposal will be studied to examine potential effects on health care costs, quality, access and equity. The sale can’t be completed until after the commission’s review and any additional reviews by state or federal antitrust authorities. Advertisement: “This is a significant proposed change involving two large medical providers, both in Massachusetts and nationally, with important implications for the delivery and cost of health care across Massachusetts,” Seltz said in a statement. Emails to Steward Health Care and Optum seeking comment were not immediately returned. The commission’s review of the transaction shouldn’t delay state and federal antitrust authorities from doing their own review to protect patient access and affordability, Democratic Massachusetts House Speaker Ronald Mariano said.

Image credit Image by ijeab on Freepik Author: Deepali Kausshik, National Health Authority. Deepali is a dedicated public health and policy professional with experience in public health research, monitoring & evaluation, and digital health. With expertise in public health and a passion for driving positive change, she has collaborated with various organizations to drive innovation and develop effective healthcare policies aimed at enhancing public health outcomes. Currently, she is working with the National Health Authority under the ABDM Scheme. The global healthcare landscape is experiencing a real transformation, driven by the integration of digital technologies into patient care and healthcare management. From electronic health records (EHRs) and telemedicine to mobile health apps and wearable devices, digital health has the potential to improve patient outcomes, enhance the efficiency of healthcare delivery, and reduce costs. However, despite the promise of these technologies, achieving widespread adoption among healthcare providers and stakeholders has been a complex challenge. With time, incentivization has emerged as a powerful tool to overcome these obstacles and drive the digital transformation of healthcare. To address the persistent issues, many countries have devised incentivization schemes to promote the adoption of digital health technologies. The Role of Incentives in Healthcare: Incentives play a pivotal role in motivating stakeholders to embrace and adopt digital healthcare technologies. These incentives can take various forms, including financial rewards, recognition, regulatory compliance, and improved workflow efficiency. By aligning the interests of different stakeholders, incentives create a sustainable environment for digital adoption in the following ways- Provider Adoption: Healthcare providers are essential actors in the adoption of digital technologies. Incentives such as financial rewards, training opportunities, and simplified documentation processes can encourage providers to integrate electronic health records (EHRs), telemedicine platforms, and other digital tools into their practice. These incentives not only streamline workflows but also improve the quality of care and patient outcomes. Patient Engagement: Patients are increasingly becoming active participants in their healthcare journey. Incentives such as access to personalized health data, remote monitoring capabilities, and telehealth services empower patients to take charge of their health. By incentivizing patient engagement, healthcare organizations can enhance patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment plans, and overall health outcomes. Interoperability and Data Sharing: Interoperability remains a significant challenge in the digital healthcare landscape. Incentives that promote data standardization, interoperability frameworks, and secure data exchange protocols incentivize healthcare organizations to share data seamlessly. This fosters collaboration, improves care coordination, and enables holistic patient management across different healthcare settings. Innovation and Research: Incentives stimulate innovation and research in digital healthcare technologies. Funding opportunities, grants, and recognition programs encourage researchers, startups, and healthcare organizations to develop and implement cutting-edge solutions. These incentives drive continuous improvement, foster collaboration between academia and industry, and catalyse the development of breakthrough technologies. Regulatory Compliance: Regulatory requirements often serve as both barriers and incentives for digital adoption in healthcare. Compliance with regulatory standards such as HIPAA in the United States or GDPR in Europe incentivizes healthcare organizations to prioritize data security, privacy, and ethical use of technology. Meeting regulatory requirements not only mitigates legal risks but also builds trust among patients and stakeholders. The comprehensive review of digital health incentive programs in several countries showcases examples of incentivization in different forms (the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Singapore, Canada, and India). By examining these programs, we aim to gain insights into their objectives, implementation, and impact on healthcare delivery. Various forms of Incentives in Healthcare Technology Adoption: United States: Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Program – The Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Program, also known as the “Meaningful Use” program, was launched to encourage healthcare providers to adopt and effectively use certified EHR technology. [1] By meeting specific criteria, providers could qualify for financial incentives. This program played a pivotal role in accelerating EHR adoption across the United States, driving improvements in healthcare data exchange and patient care. United Kingdom: Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) – In the United Kingdom, the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) incentivizes general practitioners to achieve certain quality and outcome targets in patient care. While not solely focused on digital health, the QOF includes digital health-related metrics. [2] This program has spurred innovation in primary care and incentivized the use of digital tools to improve patient management and health outcomes. [2] Australia: Practice Incentives Program (PIP) Digital Health Incentive – Australia’s PIP Digital Health Incentive encourages general practices to embrace digital health solutions, including electronic prescribing and My Health Record integration. By participating in this program, practices receive financial incentives, driving the adoption of digital health technologies and improving patient data accessibility. [3] Singapore: National Electronic Health Record (NEHR) Incentive Program – Singapore’s NEHR Incentive Program aims to create a comprehensive national electronic health record system. Healthcare institutions are incentivized to contribute data to the NEHR and adopt digital health systems. This initiative has fostered data sharing and improved healthcare coordination, ultimately benefiting patient care. [4] Canada: Digital Health Investment Review Program (iHRP) – Canada’s iHRP supports healthcare providers and organizations in adopting digital health solutions. It provides funding and resources for innovative digital health projects. By investing in digital health initiatives, Canada has enhanced healthcare access and improved patient outcomes. [5] India: Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) – The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) in India seeks to create a digital health ecosystem. It incentivizes healthcare providers and other relevant stakeholders through its Digital Health Incentive Scheme (DHIS) [6] to participate in ABDM initiatives, such as the creation of Health IDs and linking the patients’ health records. Such incentivization would help in building a patient-centric digital health ecosystem in the long run. This program holds the potential to transform India’s healthcare landscape, fostering patient-centric care and data interoperability. Challenges and Opportunities While digital health incentive programs have made significant progress, they face common challenges, including concerns about data privacy and security, interoperability issues, and resistance to change. Overcoming these challenges requires concerted efforts and innovative solutions. However, there are opportunities to enhance these schemes further: Data Standardization : Establishing global data standards can facilitate seamless data exchange and interoperability among digital health systems. Patient Engagement : Incentivizing patient participation and engagement in digital health can lead to better health outcomes and improved data accuracy. Emerging Technologies : Leveraging emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of Things can revolutionize healthcare delivery and data management. Future Directions International Collaboration : Encouraging international collaboration and knowledge sharing to learn from each other’s successes and challenges can prove beneficial. Policy Innovation : There is a need to continuously adapt and refine incentive schemes to keep pace with evolving digital health technologies and emerging healthcare needs. Research and Innovation : By embracing new ideas, we can help in increasing research and innovation in digital health to uncover new ways to incentivize stakeholders and providers effectively. Conclusion Incentivization plays a pivotal role in driving the adoption of digital health technologies, ultimately benefiting patient care and healthcare delivery. The global digital health landscape is evolving rapidly, and incentive programs are adapting to meet new challenges and opportunities. By aligning incentives with stakeholders’ interests, healthcare organizations can overcome barriers, stimulate innovation, and improve patient outcomes. As the healthcare landscape continues to evolve, effective incentivization strategies will play a crucial role in shaping the future of digital healthcare delivery. By reviewing the experiences of different countries, we gain valuable insights into what works and where improvements are needed. Policymakers, healthcare leaders, and industry stakeholders must recognize the importance of incentives and utilize their power to drive meaningful changes in healthcare. As we look to the future, international collaboration, policy innovation, and continued research and innovation will shape the future of incentivization in the digital health ecosystem, ultimately improving healthcare for individuals worldwide.

Wipro GE to invest ₹8,000 crore in India for manufacturing, R&D This investment will support the export of its ‘Made in India’ PET CT Discovery IQ scanner to 15 countries and the manufacturing of Revolution Aspire CT, Revolution ACT, and MR breast coils locally By PTI Updated - March 26, 2024 at 12:24 PM. | New Delhi × Share WhatsApp X Facebook LinkedIn Messenger Reddit Mail https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/wipro-ge-healthcare-to-invest-8000-crore-in-india-for-local-manufacturing-and-rd/article67993376.ece Copy Azim Premji | Photo Credit: RAMESH SHARMA Wipro GE Healthcare on Tuesday said it will invest over ₹8,000 crore in India over the next five years to increase local manufacturing and research and development (R&D). The company, a leading global medical technology, pharmaceutical diagnostics, and digital solutions provider, said as a part of the investment, its 'Made in India' PET CT Discovery IQ scanner will be exported to 15 countries. Additionally, locally produced Revolution Aspire CT, Revolution ACT and MR breast coils will be manufactured 'In India for the World', the company said in a statement. Local manufacturing footprint The strategic investment bolsters the company's local manufacturing footprint to address the growing domestic and international market. It will also build supply chain resiliency for the organisation, it added. Wipro GE Healthcare Chairman Azim Premji said India is riding the resurgent growth in the healthcare industry and rapidly expanding MedTech sector. "With 'Make in India', we are witnessing an exponential expansion of manufacturing footprint in the country, strengthening India's capability as the MedTech hub of the world. "Wipro GE Healthcare has been committed to this localisation journey for over three decades and this strategic investment is testament to our vision for this sector," added Premji, who is also the Chairman of Wipro Enterprises and the Azim Premji Foundation. High potential market GE HealthCare President and CEO Peter J Arduini said India is a high potential, high priority market for GE HealthCare globally. "In fact, we are among the first MedTech companies to 'Make in India - for India and the World'. We will continue to invest in expanding India's domestic capabilities and its global footprint in MedTech manufacturing and R&D," he said. Further, Arduini said, "Today's announcement is aligned with our strategic vision to deliver precision innovation globally and accelerate India's position as 'MedTech innovation and manufacturing hub for India and for world markets." Wipro GE Healthcare Managing Director and President & CEO, GE HealthCare South Asia Chaitanya Sarawate said, "As a local partner we are bullish about India's potential and its journey to be 'Atmanirbhar' and a key cog in the resilient global supply chain. "As India envisions to be among top five global manufacturing hubs in terms of value and technology for medical devices in the coming years, we are committed to the national healthcare agenda." At present, Wipro GE Healthcare has four manufacturing plants in Bengaluru. All these plants are export plants and the latest one was established in March 2022, with an investment of a little over ₹100 crore, under the Indian government's production-linked investment (PLI) Scheme, the company said. Wipro GE Healthcare is a joint venture between GE Precision Healthcare LLC, USA, and Wipro Enterprises Ltd established in 1990. Its operations spread across India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Maldives, and Bhutan. Comments Published on March 26, 2024 Companies to follow Wipro Ltd READ MORE THIS AD SUPPORTS OUR JOURNALISM.

With a poverty rate of 27.6% , access to adequate health care facilities in Liberia is limited for many citizens. The statistics are alarming , with Liberia ranking fifth in maternal mortality rate and 18th in infant mortality rate globally. Moreover, fewer than 55 physicians are available to serve the entire population, making access to health care even more challenging. The Birth of Healthy Women Healthy Liberia The Foundation for Restoring Women’s Health Care to Liberia, also known as Healthy Women Healthy Liberia, was established in response to these pressing health care issues. This initiative, led by Dr. Chris Hena, a Liberian-born medical missionary, aims to develop improved health care tailored to address the needs of women in Liberia. With her extensive experience implementing community-based health care programs in various countries, Hena recognized the urgent need to reform Liberia’s health care system. Armed with a medical degree from Kuban Medical College in Russia and a Master’s in Public Health from Emory University, United States, Hena embarked on a mission to promote the health of the Liberian people through sustainable, community-based primary health care. Mission and Focus A clear mission drives Healthy Women Healthy Liberia : to promote people’s health and educate patients through comprehensive, sustainable, community-based primary health care. With a vision to transform communities using community-based health care models, mainly focusing on women and children, the initiative aims to improve the health and welfare of the people of Liberia. By employing community-based health care models, Healthy Women Healthy Liberia envisions a country where communities thrive through access to quality health care and education. The organization seeks to create sustainable change that positively impacts the lives of women and children. Comprehensive Health Care Services Healthy Women Healthy Liberia provides a wide range of health care services to women in Liberia. Clinics established by the initiative offer treatment for various conditions, including epilepsy, asthma, diabetes, malaria and typhoid fever. Services related to pregnancy, birth control, breast health and respiratory conditions are also provided. Among these services, education on preventative health care is at the core of this initiative. Recognizing the importance of early intervention and education, there is an emphasis on programs aimed at preventing diseases and promoting healthy lifestyles, especially among women. These efforts are done to reduce the burden of illness and improve overall health outcomes in Liberia. Empowering Communities Beyond health care services, Healthy Women Healthy Liberia empowers communities through education and skill-building programs. Mother-to-mother classes, prevention courses and nutrition and food preparation instructions are provided to educate women on how to maintain their health and well-being. Additionally, initiatives such as teaching women how to build dish racks contribute to improved hygiene practices, further promoting community health. By organizing local communities into clusters and assessing their specific needs, Healthy Women Healthy Liberia ensures its programs are tailored to each community’s unique challenges and circumstances. This empowers communities to take ownership of their health and actively participate in improving healthcare services. Final Remark The Healthy Women Healthy Liberia initiative stands as a beacon of hope in Liberia’s health care landscape. Through its comprehensive approach to health care, education and community empowerment, it is making significant strides in improving the health and well-being of women across the country. With continued support and dedication, the nonprofit is paving the way for a healthier future for Liberia’s women. – Katherine Barrows Photo: Pixabay March 25, 2024 https://borgenproject.org/wp-content/uploads/borgen-project-logo.svg 0 0 Hemant Gupta https://borgenproject.org/wp-content/uploads/borgen-project-logo.svg Hemant Gupta 2024-03-25 07:30:47 2024-03-27 09:50:11 Improving Women’s Health Care in Liberia

Article Content:
Letters to the Editor Newsday Monday 25 March 2024 - Govt for the self, never the people This article explores the pivotal role CPD plays in the medical field, encompassing its significance, methods, and impact. CPD serves as a vital mechanism for medical professionals to stay abreast of advancements in medical science, technology, and healthcare practices. In a rapidly evolving field like medicine, where new research, treatments, and technologies emerge regularly, CPD provides healthcare practitioners with the necessary tools to adapt and integrate these innovations into their clinical practice. Through CPD, medical professionals engage in lifelong learning, fostering a culture of excellence and innovation within the healthcare system. Moreover, CPD ensures that healthcare practitioners maintain competency and proficiency in their respective specialties. By participating in CPD activities such as workshops, conferences, online courses, and hands-on training sessions, medical professionals enhance their clinical skills, critical-thinking abilities, and problem-solving aptitude. This continual skill development not only benefits individual practitioners but also enhances the quality and safety of patient care, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes. Furthermore, CPD plays a crucial role in addressing healthcare disparities and promoting inclusivity within the medical profession. By offering diverse CPD opportunities tailored to the needs of healthcare professionals from various backgrounds and specialties, CPD programmes facilitate equitable access to learning resources and career advancement opportunities. This inclusive approach not only fosters diversity within the medical workforce but also ensures that all patients receive culturally competent and sensitive care. The impact of CPD extends beyond individual practitioners and patients to the broader healthcare system and society as a whole. Through CPD, healthcare organisations can foster a culture of continuous improvement, innovation, and accountability, leading to more efficient healthcare delivery and resource utilisation. Additionally, CPD enables healthcare professionals to adapt to evolving healthcare policies, regulations, and ethical standards, thereby ensuring compliance and promoting ethical conduct in clinical practice. In conclusion, CPD is indispensable in modern medicine, serving as a catalyst for lifelong learning, skill enhancement, and quality improvement within the healthcare profession. By embracing CPD, medical professionals can stay at the forefront of medical advancements, deliver high-quality, patient-centred care, and contribute to the advancement of healthcare globally. As the landscape of medicine continues to evolve, the role of CPD will remain essential in shaping the future of healthcare delivery and patient outcomes. DR NEIL ADRIAN SINGH via e-mail

Article Content:
Share Tweet Share Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) marks a pivotal change in the swiftly evolving health care landscape. The adoption curve of AI in health care mirrors the classic early adopters versus late adapters scenario seen in technology uptake. As an emergency room (ER) doctor with a futurist outlook, the comparison between human roles and AI is intriguing and pivotal for understanding and navigating the future of medical care. Early adopters. These pioneers integrate new technologies into their practice ahead of the curve. They embrace the uncertainties of innovation, driven by the potential to enhance patient care and streamline operations. Late adapters. This group cautiously approaches new technology, waiting until it’s proven and risks are mitigated. Their cautious stance ensures stability but may delay access to the benefits of innovation. The critical role of AI in modern health care AI in health care is a collaborative tool that augments human capabilities. It offers unprecedented insights for improving diagnostics, personalizing treatments and predicting patient outcomes. Its role ranges from improving diagnostic accuracy to personalizing patient care plans. The imperative of AI knowledge in health care Enhancing patient care. AI’s ability to analyze extensive health data can lead to early diagnoses and timely interventions, crucial in the high-stakes ER environment. Streamlining operations. AI applications can optimize hospital operations, ensuring efficient resource allocation and patient flow, vital in emergency care. Personalizing treatment. By leveraging vast datasets, AI enables treatments tailored to individual patient profiles, improving outcomes and satisfaction. Addressing challenges Despite AI’s potential, integrating it into health care has challenges, such as ethical considerations, data privacy, and algorithmic bias. Addressing these requires collaboration between health care professionals and technologists. Human vs. AI in health care Unlike AI, human decisions in health care are influenced by experience, empathy, and the complexities of human interaction. While AI can provide data-driven support, it cannot replicate the compassionate aspects of patient care. The envisioned future is one where AI supports rather than replaces health care professionals. Conclusion Integrating AI into health care is a journey from early adoption to widespread acceptance. This journey emphasizes AI’s potential to enhance care, improve efficiency, and personalize treatments, all while navigating ethical and practical challenges. As an ER doctor with a forward-looking perspective, I view AI as an invaluable partner in improving patient outcomes. Understanding and engaging with AI is crucial for unlocking its full potential in enhancing patient care, marking a step towards a future where technology and human compassion converge to transform health care.

Some parts of this page will not display. JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off. In November, the government announced plans for a refocused health care system to ensure patients are receiving the care they need, where and when they need it. A refocused health care system includes creating four new organizations, one for each of acute care, primary care, continuing care and mental health and addiction. Health care workers, patients, families, caregivers and community leaders across Alberta have been helping shape the future of health care by participating in what is one of the largest in-person public engagements ever undertaken by Alberta’s government. To date, more than 2,500 people have participated in the in-person sessions, with an additional 18,000 Albertans providing their feedback through online tools and almost 10,000 participating in virtual town halls. In response to requests for more opportunities for face-to-face conversations about the issues and potential solutions to current health care challenges, Alberta Health has added 22 more sessions. “Our goal is to build a stronger health care system informed by Albertans with real stories and real experiences. These engagement sessions have highlighted the importance of ensuring the new health care system is informed by front-line health care experts, as they have the most knowledge of the current system and the challenges and gaps that exist. With Albertans’ help, we will build a refocused health care system that better supports the well-being of front-line workers and prioritizes the needs of patients.” These engagement opportunities are taking place in every corner of the province for residents to share their unique and diverse perspectives on how to address the health care challenges they face in their communities. Common themes emerging from the engagement sessions include the need for strong system integration to drive seamless patient experiences, more opportunities for local decision-making and the need for more health care workers. Current in-person engagement sessions will wrap up in mid-April. As the work to refocus Alberta’s health care system continues, new engagement opportunities will be developed for front-line workers and Albertans to continue providing input and feedback on shaping the future of health care. “Refocusing the health system has brought Albertans together – all coming to the table and voicing what is working well in the current system, what are the challenges, and how it can be improved. We applaud government on the largest public engagement in recent history, as well as listening and actioning the advice of Albertans. Covenant is looking forward to transforming the health care system together with a focus on holistic system outcomes where our patients and residents are at the core of all decision-making.” “We know the current health care system is not meeting the needs of rural communities, but I'm encouraged by the changes being made to refocus the health care system. From a new branch dedicated to prioritizing rural health care to the engagement opportunities in rural and remote communities, we see efforts being made to ensure Albertans get the care they need no matter where they live. We are hopeful that as the restructuring continues, further engagement will take place specifically with rural municipalities." Alberta’s government is committed to ongoing engagement with health care workers and Albertans throughout the refocusing process and beyond. Premier Danielle Smith has appointed Chelsae Petrovic, MLA for Livingstone-Macleod, as parliamentary secretary for health workforce engagement to support this work. “Engaging with Alberta's health care workers has been a cornerstone of our health system's refocusing efforts since its announcement last fall. This engagement is vital. The voices of our front-line workers are essential for understanding the realities they face, identifying areas for improvement, and gaining insight into the patient experience." As the new organizations come into place, Alberta Health will keep conversations about health care ongoing with a variety of engagement opportunities. This will include visiting regions where there have been or will be sessions on refocusing over the coming weeks. The goal is to empower front-line workers and Albertans to help shape a health care system that meets the needs of Albertans today and for generations to come. Quick facts Sixty-five in-person engagement sessions will be held by the time in-person engagement wraps up in mid-April. The government anticipates there will be no job losses for AHS staff working in front-line positions directly delivering care to patients in all health sectors. Alberta’s health care workforce continues to grow with the addition in 2023 of 331 physicians, an increase of 2.9 per cent, and more than 7,500 regulated nurses, an increase of 11 per cent.

En novembre, le gouvernement a fait part de son intention de transformer le système de soins de santé afin de garantir que les patients reçoivent les soins dont ils ont besoin, à l’endroit et au moment où ils en ont besoin. Afin de le réorganiser, il est nécessaire de créer quatre organisations : une pour les soins de courte durée, une pour les soins primaires, une pour les soins continus, ainsi qu’une pour la santé mentale et la toxicomanie. Les professionnels de la santé, les patients, les familles, les personnes soignantes et les leaders communautaires à travers l’Alberta ont contribué à façonner l’avenir des soins de santé en participant à l’une des plus vastes consultations publiques en personne jamais organisées par le gouvernement. À ce jour, plus de 2 500 personnes ont pris part aux séances en personne, tandis que 18 000 autres ont fait part de leurs commentaires par l’intermédiaire d’outils en ligne et près de 10 000 ont pris part à des assemblées générales virtuelles. En réponse aux demandes de discussions en personnes concernant les problèmes et les solutions potentielles aux problèmes actuels en matière de soins de santé, Alberta Health a ajouté 22 séances supplémentaires. « Notre objectif est d’établir un système de soins de santé plus solide, en nous appuyant sur les récits et les expériences réelles des habitants de l’Alberta. Ces séances de mobilisation ont mis en avant l’importance de garantir que le nouveau système de santé bénéficie de l’expertise des experts en soins de santé de première ligne, car ce sont eux qui connaissent le mieux le système actuel ainsi que les problèmes et les lacunes qui existent. Avec l’aide de la population albertaine, nous construirons un système de santé recentré qui favorisera le bien-être des travailleurs de première ligne et qui priorisera les besoins des patients. » Ces séances se déroulent dans toute la province afin que les habitants puissent faire part de leurs diverses perspectives personnelles sur la façon de relever les défis en matière de soins de santé auxquels ils sont confrontés dans leur communauté. Les thèmes communs qui ressortent des séances de mobilisation sont la nécessité d’une forte intégration des systèmes pour permettre aux patients de vivre une bonne expérience, l’augmentation des possibilités de prise de décision au niveau local et le besoin d’un plus grand nombre de travailleurs de la santé. Les séances en personne actuelles se termineront à la mi-avril. Durant la réorientation du système de santé de l’Alberta, de nouvelles séances de mobilisations seront mises en place pour les travailleurs de première ligne et la population albertaine afin qu’ils puissent continuer à apporter leur contribution et leurs commentaires pour façonner l’avenir des soins de santé. « La restructuration du système de santé a uni les Albertaines et les Albertains. Tous ont pris part à la discussion et ont précisé ce qui fonctionne bien dans le système actuel, quels sont les défis à relever et de quelle façon il serait possible de l’améliorer. Nous félicitons le gouvernement pour la plus importante mobilisation publique de l’histoire récente, ainsi que pour avoir écouté et mis en œuvre les conseils de la population. Covenant se réjouit à l’idée de transformer le système de soins de santé en mettant l’accent sur des résultats holistiques où nos patients et nos pensionnaires sont au cœur de toutes les décisions. » « Nous savons que le système de soins de santé actuel ne répond pas aux besoins des personnes vivant en région rurale, mais je suis encouragée par les mesures prises pour restructurer le système de soins de santé. De la mise en place d’une nouvelle direction ayant pour mission de donner la priorité aux soins de santé en milieu rural aux séances de mobilisation dans les villages et les régions éloignées, nous constatons qu’on déploie des efforts visant à garantir que les Albertaines et les Albertains reçoivent les soins dont ils ont besoin, peu importe l’endroit où ils vivent. Nous espérons qu’au fur et à mesure que la restructuration se poursuivra, d’autres engagements seront pris, notamment avec les municipalités rurales. » Le gouvernement de l’Alberta s’engage à continuer à travailler en étroite collaboration avec les travailleurs de la santé et les habitants de l’Alberta tout au long du processus de restructuration, et même au-delà.

When Will Oneview Healthcare PLC (ASX:ONE) Become Profitable? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) March 20, 2024 3 min read ONE.AX With the business potentially at an important milestone, we thought we'd take a closer look at Oneview Healthcare PLC's ( ASX:ONE ) future prospects. Oneview Healthcare PLC develops and sells software and related consultancy services for the healthcare sector in Ireland, the United States, Australia, Asia, and the Middle East. On 31 December 2023, the AU$194m market-cap company posted a loss of €8.9m for its most recent financial year. The most pressing concern for investors is Oneview Healthcare's path to profitability – when will it breakeven? In this article, we will touch on the expectations for the company's growth and when analysts expect it to become profitable. Check out our latest analysis for Oneview Healthcare According to some industry analysts covering Oneview Healthcare, breakeven is near. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2025, before generating positive profits of €1.8m in 2026. Therefore, the company is expected to breakeven roughly 2 years from today. In order to meet this breakeven date, we calculated the rate at which the company must grow year-on-year. It turns out an average annual growth rate of 75% is expected, which signals high confidence from analysts. Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected. ASX:ONE Earnings Per Share Growth March 21st 2024 Given this is a high-level overview, we won’t go into details of Oneview Healthcare's upcoming projects, though, bear in mind that by and large healthcare tech companies, depending on the stage of product development, have irregular periods of cash flow. This means, large upcoming growth rates are not abnormal as the company is beginning to reap the benefits of earlier investments. Before we wrap up, there’s one aspect worth mentioning. Oneview Healthcare currently has no debt on its balance sheet, which is rare for a loss-making healthcare tech company, which usually has a high level of debt relative to its equity. This means that the company has been operating purely on its equity investment and has no debt burden. This aspect reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company. Next Steps: There are too many aspects of Oneview Healthcare to cover in one brief article, but the key fundamentals for the company can all be found in one place – Oneview Healthcare's company page on Simply Wall St . We've also compiled a list of essential factors you should further examine: Valuation : What is Oneview Healthcare worth today? Has the future growth potential already been factored into the price?

GOLD/FOREX DUBAI 23°C PRAYER TIMES BUSINESS BUSINESS BANKING & INSURANCE AVIATION PROPERTY TAX NEWS CORPORATE TAX ANALYSIS TRAVEL & TOURISM MARKETS RETAIL CORPORATE NEWS TECH AUTO Business / Markets ANALYSIS New UAE insurance law: Will northern emirates get a wave of investments on specialty hospitals, clinics? An additional 1m residents will come under medical insurance from January 2025 Last updated: March 21, 2024 | 06:30 Manoj Nair , Business Editor 5 MIN READ UAE’s medical insurance for all employees can create one of the biggest build ups in healthcare facilities across northern emirates. Shutterstock Also In This Package Can Riyadh’s new downtown add $50 billion to economy? Photos: Diriyah unveils The Arena in Saudi Arabia Photos: UK's modern-day green airship takes shape Photos: Top 10 must watch Indian entrepreneurs in 2024 Dubai: With the UAE extending compulsory medical insurance for all private sector employees, the healthcare sector in the northern emirates could be in for a substantial increase in private sector led investments. While Abu Dhabi and Dubai already have private sector hospital operators with entrenched presence, the same will now happen across the other emirates too, say industry sources. Currently, government-owned or government-affiliated healthcare operators dominate those markets. “There have also been cases where residents in a northern emirate would seek treatment at a private healthcare facility in Dubai,” said a senior industry source. “Because there is the impression that doing so could lead to lower cost of treatment, or simply because there was no private sector option available in the other emirate.” What will change now? Effective January 1, 2025, all private sector employees in the UAE will need to have insurance cover provided by their employer. This requirement has already been there for some time in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, within and outside of their free zones. Group medical insurance will thus have to be provided by all private sector entities in the other emirates from next year. (The UAE law also applies to domestic workers.) What this would do is bring, potentially, another 1 million residents across the northern emirates into universal health insurance coverage. Many UAE insurers have been working on new medical insurance schemes to cover residents in the northern emirates Supplied M. Rajendran of Burns & Wilcox MENA Government organisations there already provide such protection to staff, and lots of privately-owned businesses also have such schemes. But the January 1, 2025 cutoff means there can be no more exemptions henceforth. “This step has been on the anvil for a long time and many UAE insurers have been working on new schemes to cover residents in the northern emirates,” said M. Rajendran, President and CEO of Burns & Wilcox MENA. “This will be a relief to many who currently do not have any medical coverage. From an employer perspective, while it may increase their operational costs, in the long run it will help them have a stable - and healthier – workforce.” How will medical plans be priced? The mention about insurers working on creating new plans specific to the northern emirates is on point. Other insurers also say that recreating the same pricing and benefits available in Dubai and Abu Dhabi may not work. Apart from the basic plan, which ranges between Dh550-Dh750 annually, the others will need some extensive reworking, they add. This initiative holds the promise of catalyzing increased investments in healthcare infrastructure, thereby enhancing the system and elevating public health standards across all the Emirates. By ensuring universal access to essential healthcare services through comprehensive insurance coverage, the resultant surge in demand for healthcare facilities is anticipated to attract fresh capital investments For insurers, one thing is clear – starting January 2025, they will have a much bigger base for their medical insurance portfolio. This is also what healthcare operators are eyeing. A bigger base of the insured will mean more people approaching healthcare providers for treatment consultations. And much more regularly at that, which has been the experience in Dubai and Abu Dhabi when universal coverage was introduced. “This initiative holds the promise of catalyzing increased investments in healthcare infrastructure,” said Dr. Thumbay Moideen, founder President of Thumbay Group. What the new law does is integrate healthcare into a broader economic diversification strategy as part of the UAE's Vision 2030 Supplied Dr. Thumbay Moideen of Thumbay Group When that happens, this translates into new hospitals, specialty care facilities and clinics multiply in the northern emirates. “The implementation of medical insurance for all in the UAE marks a monumental shift towards enhancing healthcare accessibility and quality,” said Dr. Jamil Ahmed, founder and managing Director of Prime Health. “It's a catalyst for increased healthcare spending, especially in the northern Emirates, (and) promising to elevate our healthcare system's infrastructure and services to new heights.” Implementation of medical insurance for all marks a monumental shift towards enhancing healthcare accessibility and quality. Supplied Dr. Jamil Ahmed of Prime Health Look at the numbers Any healthcare operator mulling an investment in one of the northern emirates must go over these numbers. “With a population of 10.5 million in the UAE, approximately 9.5 million individuals have insurance, leaving around one million without coverage, primarily in the northern emirates,” said Dr. Raza Siddiqui, Executive Director for RAK Hospital and CEO of Arabian Healthcare Group.(The group is working on a new 200-bed hospital in Ras Al Khaimah.) “In the absence of insurance, many companies failed to provide the necessary healthcare services. While some companies provided insurance, many did not, leaving a gap in access to proper care. In the absence of insurance, many companies failed to provide the necessary healthcare services, leaving individuals to fend for themselves. . It's crucial to understand that when bringing in expatriates, regardless of their employment level, we bear a responsibility for their healthcare Supplied Dr. Raza Siddiqui of RAK Hospital “Often, individuals sought treatment from general practitioners at low cost but received inadequate care. There have been some incidents where individuals experiencing serious medical emergencies were only given basic pain medication, leading to consequences due to delayed proper medical intervention. “It's crucial for us to understand that when we bring in expatriates, regardless of their employment level, we bear a responsibility for their healthcare. Unfortunately, until it became mandatory, this responsibility wasn't consistently met. “Although there may be initial challenges with supply and demand, the new UAE Government decision presents a significant opportunity for investment in healthcare services in the northern emirates.” Sign up for the Daily Briefing Get the latest news and updates straight to your inbox SIGN UP Up Next Related Stories Abu Dhabi F1 Grand Prix: Hotel rates surge to Dh172,487 3 m read UAE sets its 6G plan in motion 2 m read Dubai Taxi aims for 72% ride-hailing market share 4 m read ADNOC L&S posts strongest 9-month results since listing 2 m read

Title: 25 Countries With Limited Access To Healthcare

Share In this article, we will be taking a look at the 25 countries with limited access to health care. If you do not want to learn about the global healthcare market, head straight to the 5 Countries With Limited Access To Healthcare . Access to healthcare is a fundamental human right, yet many countries around the world grapple with limited access to essential medical services. This critical issue spans across various regions, affecting millions who lack adequate healthcare infrastructure, resources, and affordability. From remote rural areas to densely populated urban centers, disparities in healthcare access persist, posing significant challenges to public health and well-being. Understanding the complexities of healthcare accessibility in these nations sheds light on the urgent need for global initiatives to address disparities and ensure equitable healthcare for all. Overview of the Global Healthcare Market and Analysis of the US Health Market The global healthcare market is a significant and rapidly growing industry, valued at approximately $7.7 trillion and reached $8.5 trillion by 2020. This sector is undergoing a transformation driven by technological advancements, demographic shifts, and evolving patient needs. Key trends shaping the future of healthcare delivery include the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) for streamlining processes, sustainability practices, remote technologies for care delivery, and innovative cost management strategies. In several countries, limited health access poses significant challenges. Brazil, for instance, has universal healthcare covering 75% of the population, with the remaining 25% relying on a private system primarily funded by employers. Medical inflation in the private sector is high at 17.3%, prompting the need for solutions to manage costs effectively. Similarly, China is expanding its healthcare infrastructure, aiming to add 20,000 hospitals within the next decade and double healthcare spending from 5% to 10% of GDP. Financial statistics and data points reveal insights into the US healthcare industry. In 2020, US healthcare industry revenue totaled $1.27 trillion but experienced a significant drop due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of 2021, the industry is worth $808 billion in the US, with 65% of revenue coming from patient care. Globally, the healthcare industry is valued at $12 trillion, showing consistent growth rates over recent years. Employment in healthcare occupations is expected to grow by at least 16% between 2020 and 2030 in the US. Unveiling the Veil: Untold Realities of Global Healthcare Inflation hits global healthcare hard, particularly in the US. From 2000 to June 2023, while all goods and services rose by 80.8%, healthcare costs surged by 114.3% , reports the Bureau of Labour Statistics. The COVID-19 pandemic amplifies healthcare spending. Even as the world moves towards endemicity, COVID-19 remains a significant expense. McKinsey projects an extra $200 billion annually for COVID-19 treatment and prevention in the US. Despite escalating healthcare costs, outcomes in the US don’t match the investment. In 2020, the US spent nearly 20% of its GDP on healthcare, surpassing most nations. However, the system fails to deliver proportionate results. Life expectancy plummeted by 2.4 years from 2019 to 2021, compared to just 0.3 years in other OECD countries, per the Peterson Centre on Healthcare. Women face unequal access to quality healthcare, leading to adverse outcomes. West Virginia and Mexico have alarming mortality rates among reproductive-age women, preventable with better healthcare access. Racial disparities worsen outcomes, especially in prenatal care. Shockingly, in states like Texas and Florida, nearly 29% of females missed crucial prenatal care in 2021, worsening the situation. Misunderstanding healthcare’s role in retirement planning is dangerous. Despite 84% of working Americans underestimating its impact, 38% of retirees aged 45 to 75 retired due to health issues. This discrepancy could lead to skyrocketing healthcare costs during retirement, demanding immediate attention and planning. Leading Players in the Health Industry Companies that are actively contributing to the betterment of the healthcare industry with their innovations and contributions include DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ: DXCM ), Iqvia Holdings Inc. (NYSE: IQV ), Teladoc, and Doximity, among others. These companies are actively involved in advancing healthcare through various technologies, services, and products to enhance patient care, disease management, and overall healthcare delivery. DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), a leader in continuous glucose monitoring technology since 1999, boasts a global team of 8,000 employees dedicated to empowering diabetes management. Their latest innovation, the Dexcom G7 CGM System, offers unparalleled accuracy and integrates seamlessly with insulin pumps, expanding accessibility. With a focus on enhancing user experience and product effectiveness, DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM)’s commitment to affordability and quality has seen significant revenue growth, reaching $1.03 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023, with a full-year revenue of $3.62 billion. DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM)’s ongoing advancements include the submission of Stelo, a new glucose sensor for type 2 diabetes, for FDA review, and improvements in pump connectivity and direct-to-watch features. Iqvia Holdings Inc. (NYSE:IQV), a global healthcare leader, pioneers innovative data-driven solutions to drive advancements and better patient outcomes worldwide.

(NYSE:IQV) leverages real-world data insights and aims to positively impact the health of 2.5 billion people by 2030. Financially, IQVIA reports strong revenue growth and aims for continued expansion, with an anticipated revenue range of $15.4 to $15.65 billion for 2024. A healthcare professional in a meeting with a patient discussing care options using digital technology. Our Methodology For our methodology, we have ranked the countries with limited access to health care based on Physicians per million people. For the accuracy of data, we relied on World Atlas . Here is our list of the 25 countries with limited access to health care. 25. Guinea Physicians per Million People: 100 Guinea’s healthcare system faces challenges including high injury mortality (72.8 per 100,000) , diverse causes of death (infectious diseases, maternal conditions, neonatal issues), and rising non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Limited funding ( $2,580 per capita income) hampers healthcare investment. However, efforts by the CDC, including the President’s Malaria Initiative, aim to improve disease surveillance and control, despite infrastructure constraints. 24. Ghana Physicians per Million People: 96 Ghana’s healthcare system shows progress with a 7% decrease in institutional mortality rates from 2014 to 2018. In 2018, Ghana recorded a 66.3% rise in total deaths compared to 2017, with non-communicable diseases and maternal mortality as leading causes. Malaria prevalence in children under five decreased significantly from 26.7% in 2014 to 8.6% in 2022, but HIV/AIDS rates remain high among key populations. USAID’s support has contributed to a 50% reduction in under-five mortality between 2008 and 2022, focusing on COVID-19 response, reproductive health, nutrition, malaria, HIV/AIDS, health system strengthening, WASH, and social protection. 23. Congo Physicians per Million People: 95 The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) struggles with limited healthcare access due to financial constraints and lack of universal coverage. Hospitals detain patients for unpaid bills, with over 60% of Congolese living on less than $2.15 a day. Despite allocating $42 million for maternal and neonatal care, financial challenges persist, impeding healthcare improvements. 22. Zimbabwe Physicians per Million People: 83 Zimbabwe’s healthcare system faces challenges due to economic crises, resulting in poor infrastructure and limited medical supplies, especially in rural areas. Common causes of death include HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and non-communicable diseases. Healthcare spending is low at $21 per citizen in 2020, far below international recommendations. Rural health centers receive inadequate funding despite serving a significant population. 21. Mali Physicians per Million People: 83 Mali’s healthcare access is limited, especially in maternal and child health, leading to high mortality rates. Maternal deaths are mainly due to hemorrhage and obstructed labor, worsened in rural areas with scarce interventions like caesarian sections. With a low per capita income of $2,160 , Mali struggles with limited healthcare resources. The CDC and UNICEF support Mali’s healthcare, focusing on diseases like HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, and meningitis, while improving laboratory systems, surveillance, and workforce capacity. 20. Cameroon Physicians per Million People: 80 Cameroon faces significant healthcare challenges, including a critical shortage of personnel, low funding (only 4% of the national budget allocated to healthcare), and widespread corruption. Mortality rates remain high, with child mortality at 122 deaths per 1,000 live births, primarily due to infectious diseases like malaria. Health expenditure stands at around US$61 per capita, higher than the sub-Saharan African average but still insufficient. 19. Timor Leste Physicians per Million People: 73 Timor-Leste has made progress in healthcare since gaining independence but fac... [truncated]

Article Content:
Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], March 20: Ever since the launch of the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) by our honorable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in September 2021, India’s healthcare sector has undergone an impressive transformation, aiming to provide better health services and care to patients. One significant stride in this direction is the adoption of digital health records, which offers various benefits for patients. Let's understand how going digital with health records is revolutionizing patient care. Firstly, digital health records streamline the healthcare journey for patients. With traditional paper-based records, patients often face delays and inconvenience in accessing their medical history or test reports. However, with digital health records safely stored on an app like DRiefcase, accessible through Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA), patients can conveniently view and manage their health records all in one place anytime, anywhere. This accessibility allows patients to take charge of their health and make informed decisions for themselves. Once the health records are linked with the patient’s ABHA Card on DRiefcase, the patient’s medical data is also easily accessible by authorized healthcare providers with the patient’s consent. This seamless sharing of information facilitates better coordination among healthcare professionals, ensuring that patients receive good care. Whether it's a doctor consultation or a visit to a different healthcare facility, patients can expect continuity in their treatment journey. In fact, a remarkable 57.97+ Crore ABHA accounts have already been created, showcasing the widespread adoption of digital healthcare solutions. Furthermore, an impressive number of over 35.47 Crore health records have been seamlessly linked with ABHA, highlighting the effective integration of digital health records and there are more than 2.38 Lakh verified facilities on HFR (Healthcare Facility Registry), further emphasizing the extensive utilization of digital healthcare platforms. Digital health records also contribute to improved healthcare outcomes. With accurate and up-to-date information available through ABHA, healthcare providers can make more informed diagnosis and treatment decisions. This reduces the likelihood of medical errors and ensures that patients receive the most appropriate care tailored to their individual needs. Moreover, with the ABDM focusing on universal health coverage, digital records also play an important role in reaching the underserved population and remote areas. In conclusion, the transition to digital records signifies a notable advancement in healthcare delivery. It enhances accessibility, ensures continuity of care and improves healthcare outcomes. Embracing the digital era and moving to digital health records are crucial steps towards providing patient-centered, efficient and quality healthcare services for all. https://www.driefcase.com/create-abha-abdm-ndhm-health-id/ (Disclaimer: The above press release comes to you under an arrangement with PNN and PTI takes no editorial responsibility for the same.).

Title: Slowdown in Health Care Expenses Is Saving School Districts Billions

Yahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article. This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways Thirteen years ago this month, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA), otherwise known as Obamacare. In theory, the ACA shouldn’t have affected public school districts all that much. Most already offered health care plans that met the ACA’s requirements to at least cover 10 “ essential benefits ,” and a “Cadillac Tax” on high-cost plans that had been included in the original bill was delayed and then eventually repealed . Teachers were and remain more likely than other workers to have access to health care benefits. They also are more likely than private-sector professionals to receive ancillary benefits, like coverage for dental, vision and prescription drugs, and continued benefits after retirement. Get stories like these delivered straight to your inbox. Sign up for The 74 Newsletter But at the time ACA passed, school district health care costs were growing rapidly. According to a survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics called the Employer Costs for Employee Compensation , the price tag for teacher health insurance benefits was rising at a rate of nearly 6% per year. In contrast, inflation was growing at just over 2% a year. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Observing these patterns in the broader economy, ACA champions talked about “bending the cost curve” and reducing the rate at which health care expenses would grow over time. It worked. Within public education, district health care costs immediately began to slow. And, in the last three years, the relationship has flipped entirely, with teacher health care costs growing considerably more slowly than inflation. It’s not just happening in education. Private-sector employers are seeing similar improvements, as are other government-provided health programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. One explanation for the slower rates of growth for employers might be that they have simply shifted more of the costs onto the backs of employees. Within education, for example, the share of medical care premiums for a typical individual health care plan picked up by employers has fallen from 89% in 2010 to 85% in 2023. The comparable rate for family plans has also dipped, from 69 to 65%. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement In other words, school districts are asking teachers to pick up a slightly higher share of their health care benefits. By my rough calculations, that has cut the average educator’s take-home pay by a little more than $300 per year for those covered by individual plans and almost $900 for those using family plans. It’s also possible that the plans themselves have changed and shifted more costs onto workers through higher deductibles and co-pays and other out-of-pocket expenses. That’s hard to prove for teachers specifically, but per-person out-of-pocket expenses nationally have risen by about $175 since 2010, in real terms. That’s not nothing. But it pales in comparison to the savings on the employer side. According to the bureau’s data mentioned above, districts are saving a little over 9% of each teacher’s salary thanks to the slowdown in health care costs post-ACA. That works out to an average saving of more than $6,000 per teacher, or roughly $25 billion nationwide. Of course, districts haven’t passed all those health care savings on to teachers, at least partly because districts have chosen to stretch their budgets over more employees . Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Moreover, while districts may have seen their health care costs slow down, employee benefit costs overall continue to rise, thanks to large increases on the retirement side. As I noted in a piece for Bellwether last summer, teacher pension costs are rising about 8% every year, and they have shown no signs of slowing down. In other words, district budget officials have gotten a measure of relief from the slowdown in health care expenses. But the average school employee may not be seeing or enjoying the benefits of these trends. About Our Ads

Among its recent advancements, MedLM has new capabilities such as MedLM for Chest X-ray, which aids in classifying chest X-ray images for various purposes, including screening and diagnostics, and a Condition Summary API that offers a chronological overview of patient conditions complemented by AI-generated summaries with references, enhancing clinicians' ability to make informed decisions swiftly. The innovation represented by MedLM shows the powerful potential of generative AI to revolutionize healthcare. It equips healthcare organizations and professionals with advanced tools necessary for fostering developments in personalized medicine, clinical research, and the overall quality of patient care, marking a significant stride towards the future of healthcare technology. Analyst’s Take Google wasn't alone in making AI-based announcements at the HIMSS24 event. Its leading competitor in the public cloud market, Amazon Web Services, also introduced a range of healthcare-focused offerings. While AWS took a partner-driven approach with its solutions, Google Cloud focused on delivering foundational technologies. Its suite of healthcare solutions, including Vertex AI Search for Healthcare, the Healthcare Data Engine, and MedLM, show a comprehensive and forward-thinking approach to tackling the pervasive challenges within the healthcare sector. Vertex AI Search for Healthcare addresses a critical pain point in the healthcare industry: the need for efficient and accurate access to a vast array of health data. This tool significantly reduces the administrative burden on healthcare professionals by leveraging generative AI for medically-tuned searches, potentially mitigating physician burnout and improving patient care. The Healthcare Data Engine is the backbone of this ecosystem, providing a robust platform for data integration and management. The introduction of HDE Data Mapper is particularly newsworthy, as it empowers healthcare organizations to transform disparate data sources into unified, actionable patient records without extensive coding expertise. MedLM, with its focus on leveraging AI for medical language understanding, complements the data capabilities of HDE and the search functionalities of Vertex AI Search by providing nuanced insights and interpretations of complex medical data. The announcements by Google Cloud are a significant step forward in using AI and data management technologies in healthcare. The company’s offerings streamline workflows, enhance decision-making processes, and ultimately improve patient outcomes by providing healthcare professionals with the tools they need to navigate the complexities of modern healthcare. As these technologies continue to evolve and integrate into healthcare systems, they can transform the landscape of healthcare delivery, making it more efficient, personalized, and patient-centered. That’s goodness for everyone. Editorial Standards Reprints & Permissions

DUBLIN , March 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The "Technology Solutions In The U.S. Healthcare Payer Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Application, By Solution Type (Standalone, Integrated), By Payer Type (Government, Commercial), And Segment Forecasts, 2024 - 2030" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The technology solutions in the U.S. healthcare payer market size is anticipated to reach USD 12.6 billion by 2030. The market is expected to expand at a notable CAGR of 7.3% from 2024 to 2030. Major factors driving the market growth include enrollment and billing modernization, growing acquisition by market leaders, growing interest of investors and venture capitalists, and revolutionizing healthcare using innovative technologies. The interest of investors and venture capitalists in the healthcare payer sector is growing as technology startups focusing on this industry draw substantial attention. This increased attention is driven by several factors, such as digital transformation, value-based care, telehealth, data analytics, and consumer-centric care, highlighting the significant potential for innovation and expansion in the healthcare payer domain. The healthcare industry is undergoing rapid transformation, driven by evolving patient expectations, the shift toward value-based care, and the increasing demand for more accessible & personalized healthcare experiences. These changes have created a competitive environment for startups to introduce innovative technologies and solutions, with the potential to improve and enhance various aspects of the healthcare payer ecosystem. The initial phase of the pandemic required a strong emphasis on ensuring business continuity, member communication, and support, and these priorities remained important for the future. As the pandemic progressed from a remote concern to a global crisis, marked by extensive closure of schools and businesses for social distancing, payers found engaging with diverse stakeholders to manage the response measures collectively imperative. Healthcare payers adopted several response measures, such as establishing collaborative forums with providers and government response teams, proactive identification of high-risk members, and preparation for supply and demand imbalances. Moreover, key players in the market are engaging in strategic initiatives such as partnerships, collaborations, new product launches, acquisitions, and expansions to strengthen their market position and expand their customer base. For instance, in March 2023 , Pegasystems Inc. announced enhancements to the Pega Foundation for Healthcare. The platform will include intelligent AI-powered decision-making, personalized & responsive benefits, and expanded interoperability to help payers, care providers, & customers. Moreover, in April 2023 , Cognizant and Microsoft announced an expansion of their long-standing healthcare collaboration to provide healthcare providers and payers with access to streamlined claims management, advanced technology solutions, and improved interoperability to provide better patient and member experiences and optimize business operations. Microsoft and Cognizant are expected to work collaboratively to develop an integration roadmap between Cognizant's TriZetto healthcare technologies and Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare.

Business UnitedHealth says it’s doled out $2 billion to health care providers after cyberattack Minnetonka-based health care giant is asking clinics and hospitals to seek financial help after reports of problems receiving payments. By Christopher Snowbeck The Minnesota Star Tribune March 18, 2024 at 4:03PM UnitedHealth Group has its headquarters in Minnetonka. (Provided by UnitedHealth Group/guest) Comment Gift Share Listen UnitedHealth Group, in a public update Monday, says it’s provided more than $2 billion to health care providers that have suffered financial disruption in the fallout of a wide-reaching cyberattack. The cyberattack against its Change Healthcare subsidiary at the end of February had a cascading effect on hospitals, clinics and health care providers across the country that relied on the company’s medical information services for billing. The Minnetonka-based health care giant said Monday it continues to make progress towards relaunching those information technology systems this month. The update comes after health care providers last week told the Star Tribune about their challenges accessing assistance funds from the company. The American Hospital Association earlier this month blasted UnitedHealth’s initial financial relief program as insufficient. “We continue to make significant progress in restoring the services impacted by this cyberattack,” Andrew Witty, the chief executive at UnitedHealth Group, said in a statement. “We know this has been an enormous challenge for health care providers and we encourage any in need to contact us.” The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services met with health insurers Monday to push other companies on making advance funds available to struggling health care providers. So far, the cash crunch has not resulted in access to care problems, HHS officials say, although the department continues to hear that some small, rural and safety net providers need financial help. Getting funding to these groups is key to making sure clinics can keep providing care, HHS says. UnitedHealth Group has been asked to serve as a central clearinghouse for information and support, so that providers get connected with resources to prevent cash flow problems, the government says. UnitedHealth is continuing to enhance and expand funding support for health care providers, the company said, while making it easier for them to access those funds. In its statement, UnitedHealth said it “recognizes the high level of fragmentation of the U.S. health system can result in uneven experiences.” There’s been significant progress over the past week in getting more claims processed, officials say. The current volume of claims making it through the system, including through workarounds, is back to about 95% of normal. The cyberattack last month targeted Change Healthcare, a UnitedHealth subsidiary that runs a widely used clearinghouse for electronic claims data that processes 15 billion health care transactions annually . The systems are involved in one out of every three patient records in the U.S. UnitedHealth Group is cooperating with a federal investigation into the cyberattack while scrambling to restore the systems at Change Healthcare it was forced to shut down to contain the threat. On Monday, Change Healthcare started releasing medical claims preparation software, an important step toward restoring services. The company expects to provide third-party verification about systems being ready. The company’s electronic payments platform was restored Friday. UnitedHealth Group launched a temporary financial assistance program March 1 that used historical claims to evaluate need. This was incomplete for some health care providers and, as a result, the help offered was far too little for some. On March 7, UnitedHealth announced improvements to the initial program and a last-resort offer that could give advanced funds for health care groups without other options. “The company has launched a series of educational on-demand webinars to help providers and customers learn how to reconnect to our claims and payment networks and to explain how to take advantage of the temporary funding assistance programs,” UnitedHealth Group said Monday in a statement.

Title: 23 % returns in five - year period ; should you invest in the surging healthcare funds ?

Article Content:
Getty Images The stock universe of healthcare funds consists of about 70 stocks (excluding overseas firms), with roughly 50% being large caps. The healthcare sector mutual funds have emerged as the third best equity category, with 59% average return in the past one-year period, marking a swift turnaround from losses in the previous 12 months. Though the recent positive performance may tempt investors eager to capitalise on this structural trend, there are various nuances in ‘healthcare’ funds that investors must consider before laying their bets on these sectoral offerings. Decoding healthcare Managing over Rs.23,000 crore in assets, there are 22 healthcare sector funds today. Eight of these are passively managed, which means that they track indices such as the Nifty Healthcare, BSE Healthcare, Nifty Pharma, and others. These cost 8-40 basis points in expense ratio. Best MF to invest Looking for the best mutual funds to invest? Here are our recommendations. View Details » Of the 14 actively managed funds, 10 (higher expense ratio of 50-100 bps) have at least one-year NAV track record, while the rest are relatively new. UTI Healthcare, SBI Healthcare Opportunities and Nippon India Pharma are among the oldest schemes. Although labelled as healthcare funds , the majority (70-80%) of their assets are invested in pharmaceutical stocks. The remaining portion (15-20%) is allocated to healthcare-associated stocks, including hospitals, diagnostic chains, insurers, chemical companies, pharmacies, and others. Such companies operate under dynamics that differ from those of diversified or domestic pharma firms. Despite this, the equity market has re-rated them, following the pandemic. “Spirited stock market performance of healthcare companies (hospital and diagnostics) after Covid has resulted in higher allocation to the sector by pharma funds,” says Chandrachoodamani N.V., Senior Equity Analyst, PrimeInvestor. This segment can provide enhanced exposure to domestic businesses, including services, compared to the majority of pharmaceutical companies, which primarily focus on exports. Don’t be blinded by high 1-year returns Live Events The stock universe of healthcare funds consists of about 70 stocks (excluding overseas firms), with roughly 50% being large caps and the remaining categorised as mid and small caps. Market capitalisation distribution closely mirrors that of the BSE Healthcare index. However, certain newly launched schemes, such as Quant Healthcare and WhiteOak Capital Pharma and Healthcare, exhibit higher exposure to mid and small caps. Across actively managed healthcare funds, top holdings (in % terms) are Sun Pharma, Cipla, Apollo Hospitals, Lupin, Max Healthcare, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Aurobindo Pharma, Suven Pharma, KIMS, Divi’s, Rainbow Children’s Medicare, Gland Pharma, Abbott India and Fortis Healthcare. Most funds have 58-70% of their holdings in 10 stocks. While investing in sectoral funds, the investor wants to maximise the potential of the sector by allocating higher amounts to the best players in the sectors. “Hence, it’s fine for funds to have concentration of funds in the top 10 stocks,” points out Anand K. Rathi, Co-Founder, Mira Money. Tracking returns The recent performance surge has lifted the category scorecard of healthcare funds, with an average return of 59% over a one-year period, a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18% over a three-year period, and 23% CAGR over a five-year period. This is as per the latest data from Value Research. However, investors should note that, historically, healthcare has been a ‘defensive’ play, and tends to do well during market corrections. Data indicates that the BSE Healthcare index managed to mitigate losses during challenging years, such as 2008 and 2011. Further, if we divide the last 10 years of the BSE Healthcare index into five phases, it’s observed that healthcare funds underperformed during three rising periods, but outperformed during the two declining phases. “Instead of looking at just returns, healthcare portfolios can provide a low-correlated return stream compared with the broader markets. This can potentially boost the overall risk-adjusted return,” says financial planner Karthik Jha. A few funds, such as DSP Healthcare and ICICI Prudential Pharma Healthcare and Diagnostics (P.H.D), use the overseas route for diversification. Overseas stocks include the likes of Globus Medical, TARA, Abbott Labs, Illumina, Viatris, Intuitive Surgical and Lonza. “For a fund aiming to invest in the sector and invest in companies best positioned to grow with the current opportunity cycle, it makes sense to do the same in a geography-agnostic manner,” says Nirav Karkera, Head, Research, Fisdom. In India, the healthcare sector has been trading around long-term averages in terms of valuations. “We turned bullish on the entire pharma and healthcare space in January 2024. The sectoral funds are a good addition to the tactical portfolio allocation of MF investors who are looking to enhance returns through concentrated bets,” says Gautam Kalia, Head, Super Investor, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. Supported by a decent earnings outlook, driven by factors such as a long growth runway, healthcare funds have the potential to perform well if the markets continue to rise, while also providing a cushion against any potential declines. Analysts see an uptrend in this space due to the launch of new products in the US and India markets, loss of exclusivity opportunity across regions for generic players, priority to healthcare spend by the Indian customer, and cash-rich position of many firms.

The remaining portion (15-20%) is allocated to healthcare-associated stocks, including hospitals, diagnostic chains, insurers, chemical companies, pharmacies, and others. Such companies operate under dynamics that differ from those of diversified or domestic pharma firms. Despite this, the equity market has re-rated them, following the pandemic. “Spirited stock market performance of healthcare companies (hospital and diagnostics) after Covid has resulted in higher allocation to the sector by pharma funds,” says Chandrachoodamani N.V., Senior Equity Analyst, PrimeInvestor. This segment can provide enhanced exposure to domestic businesses, including services, compared to the majority of pharmaceutical companies, which primarily focus on exports. Don’t be blinded by high 1-year returns The stock universe of healthcare funds consists of about 70 stocks (excluding overseas firms), with roughly 50% being large caps and the remaining categorised as mid and small caps. Market capitalisation distribution closely mirrors that of the BSE Healthcare index. However, certain newly launched schemes, such as Quant Healthcare and WhiteOak Capital Pharma and Healthcare, exhibit higher exposure to mid and small caps. Across actively managed healthcare funds, top holdings (in % terms) are Sun Pharma, Cipla, Apollo Hospitals, Lupin, Max Healthcare, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Aurobindo Pharma, Suven Pharma, KIMS, Divi’s, Rainbow Children’s Medicare, Gland Pharma, Abbott India and Fortis Healthcare. Most funds have 58-70% of their holdings in 10 stocks. While investing in sectoral funds, the investor wants to maximise the potential of the sector by allocating higher amounts to the best players in the sectors. “Hence, it’s fine for funds to have concentration of funds in the top 10 stocks,” points out Anand K. Rathi, Co-Founder, Mira Money. Tracking returns The recent performance surge has lifted the category scorecard of healthcare funds, with an average return of 59% over a one-year period, a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18% over a three-year period, and 23% CAGR over a five-year period. This is as per the latest data from Value Research. However, investors should note that, historically, healthcare has been a ‘defensive’ play, and tends to do well during market corrections. Data indicates that the BSE Healthcare index managed to mitigate losses during challenging years, such as 2008 and 2011. Further, if we divide the last 10 years of the BSE Healthcare index into five phases, it’s observed that healthcare funds underperformed during three rising periods, but outperformed during the two declining phases. “Instead of looking at just returns, healthcare portfolios can provide a low-correlated return stream compared with the broader markets. This can potentially boost the overall risk-adjusted return,” says financial planner Karthik Jha. A few funds, such as DSP Healthcare and ICICI Prudential Pharma Healthcare and Diagnostics (P.H.D), use the overseas route for diversification. Overseas stocks include the likes of Globus Medical, TARA, Abbott Labs, Illumina, Viatris, Intuitive Surgical and Lonza. “For a fund aiming to invest in the sector and invest in companies best positioned to grow with the current opportunity cycle, it makes sense to do the same in a geography-agnostic manner,” says Nirav Karkera, Head, Research, Fisdom. In India, the healthcare sector has been trading around long-term averages in terms of valuations. “We turned bullish on the entire pharma and healthcare space in January 2024. The sectoral funds are a good addition to the tactical portfolio allocation of MF investors who are looking to enhance returns through concentrated bets,” says Gautam Kalia, Head, Super Investor, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. Supported by a decent earnings outlook, driven by factors such as a long growth runway, healthcare funds have the potential to perform well if the markets continue to rise, while also providing a cushion against any potential declines. Analysts see an uptrend in this space due to the launch of new products in the US and India markets, loss of exclusivity opportunity across regions for generic players, priority to healthcare spend by the Indian customer, and cash-rich position of many firms.

ARTICLE 14 March 2024 Antitrust Agencies' Health Care RFI Signals Increased Scrutiny Of PE Deals LS Lowenstein Sandler More Contributor Lowenstein Sandler is a national law firm with over 350 lawyers working from five offices in New York, Palo Alto, New Jersey, Utah, and Washington, D.C. We represent clients in virtually every sector of the global economy, with particular strength in the areas of technology, life sciences, and investment funds.

Article Insights Lowenstein Sandler are most popular: within Media, Telecoms, IT, Entertainment and Insolvency/Bankruptcy/Re-Structuring topic(s) On March 5, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division (DOJ), and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) jointly issued a Request for Information on Consolidation in Health Care Markets (the RFI), with a particular focus on private equity (PE) buyouts. The RFI seeks "public comment regarding the effects of transactions involving health care providers . . . facilities, or ancillary products or services, conducted by private equity funds or other alternative asset managers, health systems, or private payers" during a 60-day public comment period, which closes on May 6. The RFI seeks information from all health care industry "stakeholders" on the following topics: The effects of consolidation on patients, public and private payers, providers, health care workers, support staff, and employers that provide health insurance for their employees Claimed business objectives for health care transactions and whether or not those objectives were realized post-transaction Notable transactions and buyers that have been associated with adverse impacts in the past The need for government action The RFI was issued pursuant to the White House's December 2023 action plan to "lower health care and prescription drug costs by promoting competition." It is also consistent with the FTC's and DOJ's 2023 Merger Guidelines that target PE buyers. Shortly after the RFI was issued, FTC Chair Lena Khan spoke at the FTC's March 5 virtual workshop on the impact of PE in health care. Khan's remarks echoed language previously used by the White House in expressing concerns over the "growing financialization" of the health care industry and the impact of "anticompetitive roll ups" and other transactions that are not reportable under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. The DOJ has also articulated similar concerns. The FTC, DOJ, and HHS are already sharing information with each other about non-reportable transactions to help crack down on any transactions they believe could potentially pose a risk to competition in health care. Going forward, it's important to remember that the agencies are following public statements made by market participants about health care deals. Also, it is plausible that nonpublic communications by market participants could be reported to the agencies by competitors or others in the industry. The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances. Authors Zarema A. Jaramillo Jonathan A.

As Retik Finance motors past Presale Stage 9, investors are flocking in droves to seize the opportunity to be part of this groundbreaking venture. Retik Finance (RETIK): A Magnet for Investors Retik Finance (RETIK) continues to draw eager investors as it navigates through its presale stages. Right from the start, the demand for RETIK tokens has been robust, leading to each presale stage selling out ahead of schedule. This trend has only gained momentum as Retik Finance advances, with Presale Stage 9 being the latest testament to its overwhelming appeal and investor confidence. Presale Success: A Testament to Investor Confidence The consistent success of Retik Finance's presale stages underscores the trust and enthusiasm investors have in the project. Despite its early stage, Retik Finance has impressively sold out Presale Stages 1 through 9, exceeding expectations and highlighting the robust interest among investors. Notably, Presale Stage 9, aiming to sell 45 million tokens, achieved a remarkable feat by selling out in just five days. This rapid pace of token sales speaks volumes about the escalating enthusiasm and demand surrounding Retik Finance within the investor community. The project's ability to consistently meet and surpass token sale targets underscores its growing traction and the confidence investors have in its potential to deliver value in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. As Retik Finance continues to progress, its success in the presale stages serves as a solid foundation for its future growth and market penetration. Early Access to Potential High Returns Retik Finance's appeal transcends its innovative approach and a promising outlook, enticing investors with the promise of substantial returns. With a staggering return on investment (ROI) exceeding 400% since Stage 1, Retik Finance has captured the attention of a diverse investor base eager to capitalise on its growth potential. Each presale stage offers investors early access to RETIK tokens at advantageous prices, positioning them for potentially lucrative returns as the project progresses. This exclusive opportunity to acquire tokens at favourable rates acts as a catalyst for the surge in investor enthusiasm surrounding Retik Finance. As investors navigate the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape in search of avenues to maximise their investment potential, Retik Finance emerges as an appealing option, offering both innovation and significant returns. The project's impressive performance to date underscores its potential to deliver value and attract further investor interest as it continues to evolve. Limited Supply and FOMO Driving Demand The scarcity of RETIK tokens is another compelling factor fueling investor interest in Retik Finance. With a limited supply of only 400,000,000 tokens available during the presale at discounted rates, investors are keenly aware of the tokens' scarcity value and are eager to secure their portion before they are depleted. Moreover, the fear of missing out (FOMO) is exerting a significant influence on investor demand for Retik Finance. As word spreads about the project's potential and the predictions of experts forecasting RETIK's price surging to reach the $10 mark post-listing, the sense of urgency to invest in the project intensifies.

BSP Deputy Governor Chuchi Fonacier said the regulator has seen interest from foreign groups on the possible foray into Islamic banking operations in the country. “Given the current monetary conditions as well as global developments, we’ve been getting a clear interest from foreign groups ,” Fonacier told reporters. Fonacier said the first traditional bank in the country granted an Islamic banking license by the BSP is set to open a branch in Mindanao soon. “There’s already one that we’ve granted an Islamic banking license to a particular branch. So that will open soon in Cotabato. I think within this month, it will open. I just wouldn’t like to pre-empt the announcement coming from that player,” Fonacier said. She disclosed that another domestic player is also putting up an Islamic banking unit in the Philippines. “In fact, one other domestic player, although it’s a branch of a foreign bank, will also be doing Islamic banking, I think, given the need, especially in the south, in Mindanao,” she said. The BSP has dangled additional incentives as sweeteners to lure more interest in venturing into Islamic banking in the country. The BSP has issued Resolution 493, approving the modified minimum capitalization requirements for conventional banks with Islamic banking units to expand access to Shari’ah-compliant banking products and services to all Filipinos. The guidelines allow conventional commercial banks or subsidiary banks of a universal bank that meet the minimum capital requirement for their respective banking category to operate an Islamic banking unit within a transitory period not exceeding five years. Qualified conventional banks with Islamic banking units will also be given prudential relief in meeting the minimum capital requirement, which shall be based on the actual number of branches being used in Islamic banking operations. According to the BSP, the application of the central bank’s enforcement framework provides prudential safeguards to ensure accountability on the committed business plan and capital build-up plan, after the transitory period of covered banks with Islamic banking units to promote market discipline in the financial system. The central bank has maintained its flexibility to lure more interest in venturing into Islamic banking in the country after the sector was opened to new players. For one, regulatory reforms on Islamic banking licensing, as well as Shari’ah governance and taxation have been instrumental in making the Philippines an attractive site for Islamic banking. It has issued policies to implement the Islamic Banking Law and the provisions on Islamic banking under the Bangsamoro Organic Law. These are Circular 1069 on the Guidelines on the Establishment of Islamic Banks and Islamic Banking Units, which is aligned with the BSP’s risk-based licensing framework, and Circular 1070 on the Shari’ah Governance Framework, which provides for decentralized compliance, wherein adherence to Shari’ah principles will be the responsibility of the Islamic bank. In 2020, the Bureau of Internal Revenue issued Revenue Regulation 17-2020, stating that Islamic banking transactions shall not be taxed more heavily or more lightly than conventional transactions.

DUBLIN , Jan. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The "Digital Banking Platform Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2018-2028F" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. Global Digital Banking Platform Market was valued at USD 7.38 Billion in 2022 and is anticipated to project robust growth in the forecast period with a CAGR of 13.82% through 2028, The market is likely to grow in the future due to the global energy transition toward renewables and the rollout of new technologies in many developed countries. Mobile and smartphone adoption is a key driver propelling the growth of the global digital banking platform market. The proliferation of mobile devices, coupled with the increasing reliance on smartphones for everyday tasks, has fundamentally transformed the way individuals engage with their banks and manage their finances. One of the primary reasons behind the impact of mobile and smartphone adoption is the sheer ubiquity of these devices. Across the world, people from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds have embraced mobile technology. This widespread adoption has made digital banking accessible to a broader demographic, including those who may have had limited access to traditional banking services. The convenience factor plays a pivotal role in the rise of mobile banking. Smartphones allow users to access their bank accounts, perform transactions, and manage their finances from virtually anywhere at any time. Whether it's checking account balances, transferring funds, paying bills, or even investing, these tasks can now be completed with a few taps on a smartphone screen. This level of convenience aligns perfectly with the fast-paced, on-the-go lifestyle of modern consumers. Moreover, the security measures employed in mobile banking have advanced significantly, instilling confidence in users to conduct their financial transactions through these channels. Biometric authentication methods like fingerprint and facial recognition, as well as robust encryption protocols, have made mobile banking platforms secure and trustworthy. As mobile and smartphone adoption continues to grow, financial institutions are investing heavily in developing and enhancing their digital banking platforms to meet the evolving needs and expectations of their customers. This trend is not limited to technologically advanced regions but is a global phenomenon, making mobile and smartphone adoption a powerful catalyst in the ongoing expansion of the global digital banking platform market. I ncreasing Consumer Demand for Digital Services Growing consumer demand for digital services is driving the global digital banking platform market. Consumers expect convenience, accessibility, and a seamless digital experience in their banking interactions. Convenience offered by digital banking platforms includes 24/7 availability and access from anywhere. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift towards digital banking. Mobile banking apps have played a pivotal role in meeting consumer demand for digital services. Demand extends beyond basic transactions to include holistic financial solutions. Security concerns have been addressed through advanced encryption and biometric authentication. Growing demand for digital services is expected to drive sustained growth and innovation in the market. Cost Reduction and Efficiency Improvement Cost reduction and efficiency improvement are central drivers of the global digital banking platform market. Traditional banking operations face high operating costs due to physical branches and manual processes. Digital banking platforms reduce the need for physical branches, resulting in cost savings. Efficiency improvement is achieved through automation and streamlined processes. Digital banking platforms enable data collection and analysis for personalized services. Scalability allows for handling increased transaction volumes without proportional cost increases. Cost savings can be reinvested in technology development and customer-centric initiatives. Financial institutions embrace digital platforms to streamline operations and enhance customer experiences. Key Market Challenges Security Concerns Security concerns, including data breaches, phishing, and malware attacks, are significant challenges. Digital banking platforms handle sensitive customer information, making them attractive targets for cybercriminals. Phishing attacks and social engineering scams pose security threats. Malware and ransomware attacks can compromise user security. Mobile banking introduces new security dimensions, such as device loss or theft. Compliance with data protection and cybersecurity regulations is essential. Ongoing investment in robust cybersecurity measures is necessary. Regulatory Compliance Regulatory compliance represents a challenge due to complex and varied regulations across regions. KYC and AML regulations require robust procedures, potentially introducing friction into the user experience. Data privacy regulations, such as GDPR, require strict controls over personal data. Compliance requirements can evolve and change, necessitating ongoing efforts. Failure to comply with regulations can result in severe consequences. Adaptable approaches to compliance are necessary for navigating the regulatory landscape effectively. Customer Trust and Privacy Customer trust and privacy concerns can hinder the growth of digital banking platforms. Trust is essential, as digital banking platforms manage customers' financial well-being. Privacy concerns revolve around data collection, storage, and use. Data breaches and identity theft erode customer confidence. Balance between personalization and privacy is crucial. Transparent data handling practices and clear privacy policies are needed. Customer education about security measures and practices is vital. Building and maintaining trust is fundamental to the success of digital banking platforms. Key Market Trends Mobile-First Approach The mobile-first approach is shaping the digital banking platform market. Mobile banking apps offer convenience, user-friendliness, and innovation. Mobile banking reduces operational costs for financial institutions. Mobile-first development enhances user experience and customer engagement. Mobile banking bridges the financial inclusion gap and provides a competitive advantage. Security measures, including biometric authentication, ensure data and transaction safety. Mobile banking will continue to be a significant growth driver. Open Banking and APIs Open banking and APIs drive transparency, competition, and innovation. APIs enable integration of various financial services and third-party apps. Enhanced customer experience includes access to a wide range of services. Open banking fosters collaboration between traditional banks and fintech startups. APIs facilitate customization, personalization, and expansion of product offerings. Cross-border banking is made possible through APIs. Compliance and security are maintained through APIs. Open banking and APIs transform digital banking platforms into hubs for financial services. Segmental Insights Deployment Insights The Cloud segment holds a significant market share. Cloud-based services reduce IT infrastructure costs and allow for scalability. Subscription fees to SaaS providers reduce maintenance costs. Cloud-based services support rapid product deployment and scale infrastructure. Cloud deployment is preferred for its cost-efficiency and resource allocation. It reduces reliance on physical branches, which is appealing to customers.
