The cumulative shipment of PV inverters made by TMEIC India totals around 29GW or 32,126 in terms of quantity as of 2023. HT Brand Studio Published 17 Feb 2024, 05:39 PM IST TMEIC India As a significant contributor of products and services to the renewable energy sector, TMEIC (Toshiba Mitsubishi-Electric Industrial Systems Corporation) is advancing towards the goal of achieving carbon neutrality. Within its expansive network, TMEIC India, a Group company, plays a vital role in developing key solutions for the energy sector. Focused on providing environmentally sustainable energy solutions, TMEIC India is striving to facilitate the transition to cleaner energy sources. With manufacturing rotating machinery and power electronics, including motors, drives, PV inverters, and UPS (uninterruptible power supply), TMEIC India is aligned with TMEIC’s vision of “reshaping the future of energy,” said Hemant Joshi, Managing Director, TMEIC India. “The energy-efficient solutions that are designed, developed, and manufactured here in India,” said Joshi, add value to the customers’ pursuit of carbon neutrality. Energy Resource Solutions TMEIC’s Energy Resource Solutions (ERS) compasses three key concepts: Smart Factory, Green Energy, and Energy Management. While Energy Management involves electrification, energy-saving, and power supply transformation, green energy involves manufacturing PV inverters for renewable energy source plants, contributing to the growth of PV plants and wind power plants. Smart Factory, characterised by digital transformation (DX) and high efficiency, is another pillar of TMEIC's strategy. “In the realm of wind power, a recent achievement includes the delivery of an 800kW-4P generator for a wind power plant, currently undergoing testing, showcases TMEIC’s dedication to advancing rotating machinery for efficient and reliable wind power generation,” said Hemant Sawarkar, ERS Project Member, TMEIC India. Beyond manufacturing, TMEIC India provides solutions through power electronic technology. In terms of green energy, TMEIC India produces PV inverters that are delivered both in India and globally. The cumulative shipment of PV inverters made by TMEIC India totals around 29GW or 32,126 in terms of quantity as of 2023. Adopting Green Energy In its efforts to advance the use of green energy, the TMEIC India factory’s rooftop is installed with solar panels and is “currently a zero-emission facility,” said Sawarkar. TMEIC’s rotating machinery exhibits precise power with energy savings and reduction of carbon footprint across varied applications. In the realm of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), TMEIC plays a crucial role with high-power, water-cooled MV Drives, along with large capacity synchronous motors. “Our high-capacity motors manufactured in India since 2016 are high-efficiency motors, meeting market needs and various specifications,” said Sawarkar TMEIC India offers high-efficiency series fin frame motors, sourcing approximately 97 per cent of components locally. This approach helps the company enhance its supply network, not only within India but also in the Middle East. This expansion contributes to the stability of plant operations, while also reducing logistics costs and energy consumption. Current Focus In 2021, TMEIC launched a company-wide project to build ideas and develop solutions for energy resources. Tohru Fukiage, ERS Project Manager, TMEIC, said, “Through our activities so far, we have come to focus on developing advanced rectifiers to be applied to the electrolytic hydrogen and new power converters and electric furnaces.” Anticipating a significant business expansion, TMEIC’s initiatives will continue to help the customers achieve their carbon neutrality goals. As Fukiage foresees the power network to become highly unstable in the near future, the current focus of the company lies in advancing “towards a sustainable and carbon-neutral future.” Click here to learn more about TMEIC India: Technology, Products and Automation Solutions for Industries Worldwide | TMEIC Disclaimer: This article has been produced on behalf of the brand by HT Brand Studio.

LOUIS COUNTY, Mo. – Ameren Missouri is planning to build a natural gas-fueled energy center in south St. Louis County on the grounds of a former coal-fired power plant. Ameren announced plans for the Castle Bluff Energy Center earlier this week near the confluence of the Meramec and Mississippi rivers. The company describes the plant as a backup source of energy that’s “designed to bolster grid reliability” and “deliver energy on the hottest summer days, the coldest winter days or when renewable energy is not generating as forecasted.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Water rescue underway in Washington to find man who may have entered Missouri River Ameren says the energy center would create new jobs and sources of revenue for the St. Louis region while also dropping carbon dioxide emissions by 40% compared to its previous coal site, which closed near the end of 2022. The new energy center also aims to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by 80% and sulfur dioxide emissions by 99%. The Castle Bluff Energy Center needs approval from the Missouri Public Service Commission, but with it, construction could start as soon as 2025.

Photo Release MANILA, Philippines — Energy management and digital automation firm Schneider Electric is urging Philippine data centers to use the “green approach” as part of smart and sustainable solutions to lessen energy consumption. Schneider Electric business development and marketing director Carlos Leviste said data centers have become integral to the country’s rapidly growing internet economy. “The need to transition to sustainable operations has become more pronounced,” Leviste said. According to Leviste, data centers have previously utilized fuel to run its operations, marking the facilities as “energy-intensive.” Schneider Electric said data centers should shift to electricity and digital, specifically energy management systems and digital tools, which promote sustainability and operational efficiency. “Data centers, equipped with smarter operations, can optimize costs, speed and capital to prepare them for future technological integrations and risk mitigation,” the firm said. Schneider Electric offers solutions for data centers to improve efficiency and sustainability through American Power Conversion, which offers high-efficiency uninterruptible power supplies, cooling units and monitoring systems. It said the oil-free cooling centrifugal compressors with magnetic bearings chiller systems allows data centers to consume power more efficiently and sustainably. “Through these solutions, data center facilities can reduce operational costs in design and engineering, function using grid-compliant assets and software with reduced cybersecurity risks and ensure proactive maintenance of assets to maintain optimum uninterrupted performance,” Schneider Electric power and grid sales leader for Asia Pacific Sara El Fanidi said. More energy companies are also launching data center solutions for sustainability. Singapore-based Enercon Asia is supporting rapidly growing industries such as microgrids and data centers. Enercon’s Remote Energy Monitoring System, alongside the Data Center Power System solutions will support businesses in adapting to the “ever-changing landscape of energy consumption efficiency.” “Through site verification, measurement, monitoring, and analysis with state-of-the-art smart energy monitoring equipment, our teams ensure that clients have a thorough understanding of their energy consumption patterns, on top of meeting compliance requirements,” Enercon CEO Roland Lim said. The CEO said on Thursday that Enercon’s solution furnishes businesses with insights into their energy consumption patterns. “Moreover, it facilitates remote monitoring of facilities’ energy usage, empowering businesses with enhanced control and efficiency in overseeing their energy resources,” Lim said. International research organization on global data centers Uptime Institute sees a 500-percent growth in data generated globally from 2019 to 2025. The operations of data centers are energy-intensive accounting for about one percentof global electricity consumption. ENERGY BrandSpace Articles 50 winners of P50,000?

The board also approved an updated dividend policy beyond 2024, which is expected to translate to a growth rate in dividends per share of roughly 10% per year through at least 2026, off a 2024 base, which is expected to be $2.06 per share. ""The board's approval to continue to grow our dividends per share in excess of our expected adjusted earnings per share growth rate is a result of our success in executing on our industry-leading business strategy,"" said John Ketchum , chairman, president and chief executive officer of NextEra Energy. ""With a 59% payout ratio at the end of 2023, below the peer average of approximately 65%, and the continued strength of the earnings and operating cash flow growth at NextEra Energy, we remain well positioned to support the dividend policy going forward. I believe we continue to offer a best-in-class total return potential, with above-average dividend growth and clear visibility to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in each year through 2026, while maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings.""

Yet investors, like Fidelity’s energy sector portfolio manager, are optimistic for 2024 , pointing to tight supply, robust demand, and higher production investments as reasons for potential growth in energy stocks. Among these, Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM ) has been standing out as a leader in oil and gas exploration, production, refining, and marketing. Its comprehensive involvement in the energy field offers investors a varied portfolio. Inspired by its success, many energy companies have also thrived in the industry, reaching high potential. Furthermore, Morningstar predicts that the U.S. electricity demand will grow by 1.4% annually until 2032 , with solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal companies leading this surge. This growth, along with stable oil prices, presents a promising outlook despite the ongoing volatility, showcasing a sector rich in both traditional and innovative investment opportunities. So, let’s explore the three energy stocks investors shouldn’t ignore. Energy Stocks: Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD ) stands out in the energy sector by providing essential services to a diverse client base in crude oil, natural gas, and natural liquid gas markets. Over the past year, EPD’s share price has risen by 0.8% . Impressively, the company offers a strong dividend yield of 7.6% , supported by 25 consecutive years of distribution growth as of 2023. In a recent financial showcase, EPD reported a revenue surge to $14.62 billion , marking a 7.12% increase year-over-year ( YOY ). Earnings-per-share ( EPS ) also exceeded expectations by 4 cents, coming in at 72 cents. Furthermore, the firm upped its cash distribution by 5.1% after completing $3.5 billion in capital growth projects. Moreover, EPD showcased its operational efficiency by launching two new natural gas processing plants in the second half of 2023. These facilities quickly reached full capacity, underscoring the high demand for EPD’s services. TipRanks analysts echo the positive sentiments , giving EPD a ‘strong buy’ rating with a 22.15% upside potential. NextEra Energy (NEE) Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE ) shines brightly in the renewable energy cosmos due to its vast wind and solar endeavors. The Cavendish NextGen Hydrogen Hub in Okeechobee County, Florida, showcases the company’s pioneering spirit. This clean hydrogen facility stands as a testament to NextEra’s commitment to exploring sustainable energy innovations. Financially, NextEra Energy showed potential as its EPS of 52 cents soared past Wall Street predictions, alongside a revenue triumph of $6.88 billion, which exceeded estimates by a whopping $557 million. A strategic play further buoyed this financial prowess during a 14% plummet in natural gas prices, attributed to sufficient storage and an unexpectedly mild winter. Looking forward, NextEra Energy aims for an adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8% annually through 2026 from 2024 levels. With TipRanks analysts giving NEE stock a ‘moderate buy’ rating and predicting a 25.01% upside potential, the future indeed looks bright for this renewable energy titan. Devon Energy (DVN) Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN ), a leader in hydrocarbon exploration, excels in the upstream energy sector, boasting a five-year dividend growth rate of 21.67% . This demonstrates the company’s durability and potential for future growth. Embracing renewable energy, Devon has invested $10 million in Fervo Energy , a pioneer in geothermal technology, showing its commitment to the renewable sector’s future. Moreover, DVN’s strategy goes beyond mere investments to include bold acquisitions, notably its pursuit of Enerplus Corp . This effort aims to strengthen its oil and gas sector presence, boost its operational capabilities, and diversify its portfolio. Financially, DVN exceeded expectations with an EPS of $1.65 , surpassing forecasts by 10 cents. Despite a YOY revenue drop of 29.3%, the company still managed to outdo revenue expectations by $211 million. This financial prowess, coupled with a ‘moderate buy’ rating from TipRanks analysts and a 31.38% upside potential, positions Devon Energy as a compelling investment choice.

Threats to safe passage through the strategic waterway have caused delays and detours, resulting in increased fuel costs and snags in the global supply chain, according to media reports. Thus, it is a bad time for the Biden administration to further weaken global energy security. Recommended Stories Fast-track post-traumatic stress treatments. Our veterans can’t wait A promise to those who served Veterans defended our homeland and now they need a place in it Instead of embracing all forms of American energy as strategic assets and expediting infrastructure projects, the White House is in retreat. In the process, it is signaling to United States friends overseas that America may backtrack on its promises. To paraphrase former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher: With all the ongoing geopolitical chaos, now is no time for America to go wobbly. But that’s what the administration did last month in halting pending and future U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export approvals. In an ideal world, the administration would value the good that America’s natural gas and oil abundance brings in advancing security, stabilizing global markets, and reducing emissions. Instead, the administration has left some allies wondering about the reliability of America’s promises. President Joe Biden pledged to supply Europe with U.S. LNG to fill a supply gap left by nations moving away from Russian piped natural gas. But the need isn’t short-term or otherwise momentary. Europe faces supply questions for the future that America’s LNG could answer. Among other restrictions on U.S. energy leadership, the LNG pause is a win for Russia and an alarming turnabout for U.S. allies. Biden should immediately reverse it and embrace the advantages of being the world’s leading producer of natural gas and oil — the leading producer in all of history. America’s energy advantage is national security that comes from access to abundant energy, which also shields America amid volatility. This advantage wasn’t built overnight. It won’t be sustained without smart policies from Washington. Beyond our shores, we have used the American energy advantage to help our friends, whose security is closely connected to our own. In addition to providing opportunity for other countries to realize reduced emissions that result from switching from coal to cleaner natural gas, America’s energy advantage means our allies do not have to turn to unstable governments and state-owned sources to keep the lights on. Examples abound in recent history. In 2022, America’s LNG producers helped Europe avert the worst of an energy crisis that followed Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing turmoil. And 50 years ago, the U.S. learned the meaning of energy security — or lack thereof — during the 1973 oil embargo. Secretary of State Antony Blinken even admitted that “we’ve not seen a situation as dangerous as the one we’re facing now across the [Middle East] since at least 1973.” Let’s act to spare the U.S. and our allies from that era of energy insecurity. Looking ahead, it is reasonable to assume that some countries will remain eager to weaponize energy. To insulate ourselves and our allies, America’s energy leadership should include all energy sources – traditional and new. But the White House’s current over-reliance on still-maturing energy sources, while abandoning proven ones, will not strengthen our energy advantage or global energy security. Instead, we risk increasing our reliance — and that of the world’s — on Chinese-controlled manufacturing and critical mineral supplies. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM RESTORING AMERICA With the global population expected to grow 20% by 2050, we need more energy sources, not less — specifically, more oil and natural gas, which provided 70% of America’s energy in 2022. We will also need more wind, more solar, and more modern infrastructure to support them all. If it’s energy made in America it keeps the lights on, and it’s produced safer and cleaner, Washington should support it—because it bolsters both U.S. and worldwide energy security. Diplomatic alarm bells are ringing. Conflicts are brewing in strategic hotspots worldwide. If the White House’s vision is restricting the use of our natural resources, then the question here and around the world is direct: If not America’s energy, then whose? The answer could have grave consequences for ourselves and our friends. Amanda Eversole is executive vice president and chief advocacy officer at the American Petroleum Institute.

The average home currently pays £1,928 a year for gas and electricity bills as they are on a tariff regulated by the Ofgem price cap, which is set four times a year. But expert energy analysts at Cornwall Insight believe the price cap will fall to £1,635 a year from 1 April. That rate applies to a home with average energy use, on a variable-rate energy tariff and paying by direct debit. The current price cap sets the energy bills paid by more than 80 per cent of UK homes, though the exact amount varies depending on gas and electricity use. Feed the meter: Energy bills have been high since late 2021, when prices began to skyrocket The price cap is then reset in July and once again in October. Cornwall Insight thinks the average gas and electricity bill will fall again to £1,465.07 in July, before rising to £1,523.95 in October.

Share this article Share HOW THIS IS MONEY CAN HELP Economy 7 customers now WON'T lose cheap off-peak energy in March as firms extend deadline Cornwall Insight principal consultant Craig Lowery said: ' Forecasts show energy bills returning to their lowest levels in over two years, providing a much-needed respite for a nation struggling with a cost of living crisis. 'Fairly healthy gas supply across the Atlantic, coupled with high storage levels in Europe, are helping to keep bills down. But we mustn’t get too complacent. Our energy system is still walking a tightrope, and we cannot be sure another political or economic crisis won’t send bills straight back up. 'Even with the drop, prices will remain a struggle for many. We need to remember, bills remain hundreds of pounds above pre-pandemic levels, and if we don't speed up the switch to sustainable energy and cut down on volatile imports, they are likely to stay that way.' When will cheap fixed energy deals come back? A big question for consumers is whether lower, more stable energy bills could encourage energy firms to bring back cheap fixed-rate deals. Fixed-rate tariffs have historically been far cheaper than variable rates, but dried up once energy prices began soaring in late 2021. While energy companies have started relaunching fixed rate energy deals , many are more expensive than staying on the price cap, or only available to existing customers. Uswitch director of regulation Richard Neudegg said: 'Prices are forecast to fall again in July, but the market remains unpredictable, and it is hard to know how energy rates will look when usage climbs again in winter. 'With more than just a glimmer of hope on the horizon for wholesale energy costs, all eyes are now on suppliers to see how they will price their other deals. 'Consumers have waited long enough for better tariff choices, and desperately need the opportunity to take advantage of cheaper rates.' Tempted to fix? What to consider... With more energy suppliers now offering fixed energy tariffs, many households might be considering signing up to one once again, writes Sam Barker. Before taking the plunge, it is vital to consider these four steps: 1. Make sure the deal is a good one To work out if an energy deal - fixed or otherwise - is cheaper than you are paying now, compare the unit rate and standing charge with what you currently pay. There are several fixed rate energy deals that are more expensive than staying on the Ofgem price cap. The average home is paying rates limited by this price cap, which means 53p a day in electricity standing charges and 30p for gas, while electricity unit rates are 29p per kilowatt-hour (kWh) and 7p/kWh for gas. The massive variable is what happens with the Ofgem price cap in the future. It might be possible to lock into a cheaper deal now, only to see the price cap fall significantly, leaving you overpaying. 2. Remember to check the exit fees Many fixed-rate energy deals come with steep exit fees, which you will pay if you try to leave the deal early. These can be as high as £150 each for gas and electricity. 3. Check your emails At the moment there are very few fixed-rate energy deals on the open market. But many energy firms do have some fixes only open to their existing customers. They advertise these by emailing their customers, so remember to check all emails from your energy firm.

We should happily oblige and move toward a more optimistic, more realistic narrative of abundance and innovation supported by public policy. Deprivation and crisis marked U.S. energy policy in the 1970s. Too reliant upon unfriendly regimes, the Arab oil embargo caused fuel shortages, skyrocketing gas prices, and long lines at the gas pump. President Gerald Ford told the public to “drive less, heat less.” President Jimmy Carter , who put solar panels on the White House , then warned of a pending “national catastrophe” unless the public curbed its energy consumption.

Our veterans can’t wait A promise to those who served Veterans defended our homeland and now they need a place in it Their words fit neatly with environmental elitists such as scientists Paul Ehrlich and Amory Lovins, who believed the problem was a society with access to “cheap, abundant energy.” They were particularly worried about the peaceful usage of nuclear power. “It’d be little short of disastrous for us to discover a source of cheap, clean, and abundant energy because of what we would do with it,” Lovins said in 1977, referring to nuclear energy. Nearly five decades later, the “consume less” narrative is being implemented through energy efficiency programs for everything from lightbulbs to leaf blowers, bans on natural gas appliances, fuel standards for cars, and mandates to electrify transportation. At the same time, energy efficiency advocates, such as Lovins, are championing less efficient, intermittent sources such as wind and solar to power our grid, thereby forcing energy scarcity upon us. We should challenge the energy deprivation narrative. The public is fortunate to live in a country that is resource-rich and diverse, where coal, natural gas, and oil can be responsibly developed and new technology is encouraged. Three uranium mines opened late last year. And the Fervo-Google project in Nevada demonstrates the promise of geothermal. In a 2022 paper, energy optimists Austin Vernon and Eli Dourado from the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University dared to ask, “What would it be like if we were able to consume vastly more energy?” Coining the phrase “energy superabundance,” they explored the idea that energy policy should focus on being clean, cheap, and plentiful rather than restricted, unreliable, and expensive. They encourage looking at resources through the lens of their potential rather than simply emissions. The optimism of their premise is attractive. U.S. energy production has tripled since 1950, as reported by the Energy Information Association. In the second week of December 2023, the United States set a production record of 13.3 million barrels of oil per day despite a 69% decline in oil rigs. The country is well positioned to stake its flag in energy dominance on the global stage. At the same time, we’ve cleaned up the planet, too. The Environmental Protection Agency reports that between “1970 and 2020, the combined emissions of the six common pollutants dropped by 78%.” In addition, we’ve cleaned up our waterways. The bottom line is we’ve become great stewards of our environment. What should we do to benefit from energy abundance? First, dump the energy poverty mindset. Energy usage, educational attainment, and economic prosperity go together. We should instead develop a reality-based mindset that we can develop our natural resources responsibly, enjoy a clean environment, and benefit from a healthy, thriving economy that relies upon clean, affordable, reliable, abundant energy. Second, the government should get out of the way and let the markets work. The government is lousy at picking winners and losers, usually influenced by political motives rather than scientific principles. Stop using public funds to support costly, unreliable, and weather-contingent energy sources that squander financial resources and destabilize the power grid. Similarly, taxpayer money should not be used to back products such as electric vehicles that lack consumer demand. Lastly, we must educe green tape and unleash innovation. Today, environmental concerns are used to delay or halt necessary generation and production projects for sources that work. The Keystone Pipeline and the recent “pause” on approvals of much-needed liquefied natural gas exports are recent examples. We’ve proven we can develop resources responsibly and be good environmental stewards. We need regulatory reform and the streamlining of our permitting process to reflect that reality, especially for clean, reliable nuclear energy. Energy is our economic paradigm. It’s in everything. To ensure our children and grandchildren enjoy a higher standard of living and a clean environment, we need to embrace energy abundance so that energy costs are lower, innovation is rewarded, and consumption isn’t demonized. Otherwise, they’ll be destined to relive the 1970s. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM RESTORING AMERICA Amy O. Cooke is a visiting energy policy fellow at State Policy Network.

In England, official statistics consider a household to be in fuel poverty if their home has a poor energy efficiency rating of band D or below and their disposable income after housing and fuel costs is below the poverty line. The data from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero shows 13% of households in England were in fuel poverty last year, largely unchanged from 13.1% in 2022. The figure would have been more than 3.5 million households in fuel poverty without Government support including energy bill payments and the cost-of-living income payments given to people on low incomes, the data showed. The data also reveals well over a third of households (36.4%) or some 8.91 million were forced to spend more than 10% of their income, after housing costs, on domestic energy bills, up from 6.66 million in 2022. Due to energy improvements there has been a slight increase in the proportion of low income households living in a property with a fuel poverty energy efficiency rating of Band C or higher, pulling them out of fuel poverty according to the statistics. Some 54% of all low income households live in a property with an energy rating of C or above, up from 53.1% in 2022, the figures show. The fuel poverty gap – the reduction in fuel costs needed for a household not to be in fuel poverty – jumped in 2023 to £417, from £348 the year before. Simon Francis, co-ordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said the figures do not paint the “true picture of suffering” as they exclude millions of homes in certain energy performance categories and many people who receive a Warm Home Discount for their bills. He added: “The numbers of households paying more than 10% of their income on energy is truly shocking, far exceeding previous estimates. “The reality is that household energy debt is now at record levels, millions of people are living in cold, damp homes and children are suffering in mouldy conditions. “The wider impact of high energy bills is also clear to see with households having to cut back on spending so much that the UK has now entered a recession.” Greenpeace UK climate campaigner Georgia Whitaker said: “Progress on tackling fuel poverty is flatlining, despite the ongoing energy crisis, which has forced those on the lowest incomes to freeze in their own homes. “The cheapest and most effective way to help is to insulate homes, but Government funding for energy efficiency schemes was pushed off a cliff edge by ministers over a decade ago.” She criticised moves to remove the legal requirement on private landlords to insulate homes, and urged Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to “drop his anti-green agenda” as measures – such as insulation – to tackle the climate crisis also ease the cost of living. A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: “We’re providing an average of £3,700 per household to help with bills, and the latest figures show that our energy bill support schemes and progress in making homes more energy efficient have protected hundreds of thousands of households from fuel poverty. “We’ve halved inflation, and energy prices are now significantly lower than their peak last year – but we recognise the cost-of-living challenges that families are still facing and will continue to target support at those most in need.”"

Kumar also pointed out that the rooftop solar scheme launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi would elevate the rooftop solar sector to unprecedented heights in the country. “This visionary project, backed by an investment exceeding Rs 75,000 crore, aims to solarise one crore households by providing up to 300 units of free electricity every month,” he said. “The scheme will not only provide substantial benefits, but also foster awareness about renewable energy among the people at large, contributing to India's ambitious goal of achieving Net-Zero emissions by 2070 and Energy Independence by 2047,” he added.

Until sufficient energy storage for renewable energy is achieved, thermal energy will also be developed alongside,” Kumar said. He hailed the government for taking a host of initiatives in the renewable space that have helped India become a role model for renewable energy development worldwide.

By Melanie Wolkoff Wachsman Updated on February 14, 2024 Click to Add Comments Print Facebook Twitter Instagram Pinterest February 13, 2024 Energy drink consumption is associated with an elevated risk for physical and mental health conditions such as ADHD, depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation among children and adolescents, according to a new study published in the journal Public Health . 1 The study’s U.K. research team linked energy drink consumption with a higher-than-average risk of poor academic performance, sleep problems, unhealthy dietary habits, and risky behaviors. Children and teens who consumed energy drinks were more likely than non-drinkers to engage in unsafe sex and vehicle use, binge drinking, vaping, violent behaviors, and alcohol and substance use. Energy drink consumption was also tied to increased ADHD inattention , conduct disorder, and depressive and panic symptoms. The rates of suicidal ideation and attempts increased among those who drank more than one energy drink a day compared to non-drinkers. 1 The systematic review examined 57 studies about the effects of energy drinks on children and young people up to age 21 from January 2016 to July 2022. The data came from more than 20 countries and involved more than 1.2 million children and young adults. (The review did not include the brands of energy drinks consumed.) The report confirmed findings from a similar review in 2016 conducted by the same research team. 2 What Are Energy Drinks? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines an energy drink as “a beverage that typically contains large amounts of caffeine, added sugars, other additives, and legal stimulants such as guarana, taurine, and L-carnitine. Energy drinks are marketed as providing mental and physical stimulation; they contain no nutritional value. The amount of caffeine in energy drinks typically exceeds adults’ daily recommended doses. Data from the Center for Science in the Public Interest shows that energy drinks may contain as little as 75mg of caffeine — slightly less than one average cup of coffee — or up to 316mg per 8 ounces, the equivalent of more than three cups. Energy drinks have exploded in popularity in recent years, particularly among teens. A 2013 study of 37,500 children and adolescents in 16 European countries found that 18% of children (3–10 years) and 68% of adolescents (10–18 years) consumed energy drinks in the previous year.8 Between 12% and 35% of children and young adults consume them at least once per week. 3 The U.K. study found that male teens consume more energy drinks than do females. Taste and energy-seeking were the main drivers of energy drink use. The study also reported that children and teens may turn to energy drinks as a coping mechanism, out of social acceptance, or to enhance performance on tests and in sports. Energy Drink Consumption Among Kids with ADHD Nearly 5% of ADDitude Reader Panel members say their children consume energy drinks every day or regularly, according to a recent survey. “My children like to drink Prime because they think it’s cool, and they like the taste,” one reader said. “My daughter tries out the latest fads with energy drinks,” said another reader. “I worry about her caffeine consumption. I keep teaching her to watch the caffeine content and to be careful about how much she drinks. I don’t see her drink them — I just see empty containers in her car — so I can’t say what the effect is on her ADHD symptoms.” Another reader shared that her daughter (now 21) “has used Red Bull daily since high school. She is currently unmedicated (Her choice, not mine.) I believe it helps her focus a little.” An additional 12% of ADDitude Reader Panelists said their children occasionally consume energy drinks. “My teen kids will have an energy drink (Yerba Mate or Celsius) now and then for sports or athletic activities like between soccer games on tournament weekends or when skiing,” a reader said. “It adds to their energy, which is fine when engaging in physically demanding activities. I would not allow it before school as it likely would create jitteriness if they had to sit for hours.” “My child occasionally swipes a sip of his dad’s Red Bull,” said another reader. “Other than that, he doesn’t drink them. We mostly avoid energy drinks because of the additional additives in them.” Less than half (44%) of reader panelists said their children are prohibited from consuming energy drinks. “I am fearful of the jittery anxiety it seems to produce,” one reader said. “The [energy drink] crash has caused my son to melt down and become horribly embarrassed when in public.” “I do not want myself or my children to have energy drinks because they are high in sugar and caffeine,” another reader said. “We have diabetes and heart disease in our family, and we do not need to add on to that.” Other readers offer energy drink alternatives. “We don’t allow our kids to have energy drinks as they contain harmful ingredients,” the reader said. “We have allowed our kids to try coffee. They don’t care for the taste, but it did help my son to be less crabby in the morning.” “There’s too much empty sugar and caffeine in them,” another reader said. “As a special treat, my teens with ADHD buy themselves sweet drinks at Starbucks. I encourage caffeine-free drinks. The body is hard enough to understand and regulate without all the added effects of sugar and caffeine.” Energy Drinks: Next Steps The observational study could not prove causality between energy drink consumption and poor health outcomes; the drinks could, for example, be more popular among adolescents with naturally low levels of dopamine and/or those facing higher risks of mental and physical health issues. However, the researchers said their findings were strong enough to suggest policymakers consider banning the sales of these products to children. “We have raised concerns about the health impacts of these drinks for the best part of a decade after finding that they were sold to children as young as 10 years old [for less] than bottled water,” lead author Amelia Lake, Ph.D., a professor of public health nutrition from Fuse, the Centre for Translational Research in Public Health at Teesside University in England, said in a press release . “The evidence is clear that energy drinks are harmful to the mental and physical health of children and young people as well as their behavior and education. We need to act now to protect them from these risks.” The American Academy of Pediatrics states that caffeine and other stimulant substances contained in energy drinks have no place in the diet of children and adolescents. 4 Keeping Energy Drinks Out of Children’s Hands — and Mouths The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offered the following tips for caregivers and educators: Teachers and other school staff can educate students about the danger of consuming too much caffeine, including energy drinks. Coaches can educate athletes about the difference between energy and sports drinks and the potential dangers of consuming highly caffeinated beverages. School nutrition staff can provide only healthy beverages such as fat-free/low-fat milk, water, and 100% juice in the cafeteria. Parents, school staff, and community members can join the school or district wellness committee that sets the policies for health and wellness and establish or revise nutrition standards to address the sale and marketing of energy drinks in school settings. Adults can model good behavior by not consuming energy drinks in front of kids. View Article Sources 1 Ajibo, C., Van Griethuysen, A., Visram, S., Lake, A. A. (2024).

Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian View image in fullscreen Common Wealth said state-led investment in clean energy would save households money on their bills. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian This article is more than 1 year old Labour urged to double funding in publicly owned renewables This article is more than 1 year old Cash injection in Great British Energy should be increased to £30bn, thinktank says after Keir Starmer U-turn Keir Starmer is being urged to more than double Labour’s investment in publicly owned renewable energy to save consumers billions of pounds on their bills, despite the party drastically scaling back its plans last week. In an intervention after the Labour leader scrapped the party’s £28bn green investment pledge in the most controversial U-turn of his leadership, the Common Wealth thinktank said a step-change in government backing for clean energy generation was still required. It said plans to retain an initial cash injection in Great British Energy – a state-owned renewable power generation company planned if Labour is elected to power – was an important “down payment”, but should be increased to £30bn over the course of a first term in office. There have been growing questions over Labour’s target to decarbonise the UK’s electricity system by 2030 after it slashed the funding package behind its green economy plans by half. As a key group influencing Ed Miliband, the shadow net zero secretary, Common Wealth was the first thinktank to promote a new publicly owned energy generator – providing backing for GB Energy – based on similar European firms such as Sweden’s Vattenfall, Denmark’s Ørsted and Norway’s Equinor. Miliband is understood to have pushed back against the dilution of Labour’s £28bn investment plan, with speculation – denied by his team – that he could resign over the issue. However, in a sign of unity, he contributed a quote to the press release confirming it would be scaled back. Labour has said GB Energy would be headquartered in Scotland as a “homegrown, publicly owned champion in clean energy generation” to enable the creation of jobs and manufacturing in Britain’s renewables sector. However, several details remain unclear , including whether it would operate green assets directly or control a portfolio of investments in other companies instead. Labour said last week that GB Energy would “partner with industry” and “co-invest” in groundbreaking green technologies such as floating offshore wind, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and tidal stream energy. It has also suggested the party would help capital-intensive projects such as the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk with “backing and building”. The government is, however, seeking significantly more investment for the project than Labour currently plans for GB Energy, with ministers looking to raise £20bn from outside investors after removing the Chinese state-owned group CGN in 2022 over security concerns. In a report setting out the case for a vast expansion of GB Energy in the early years of a Labour government, Common Wealth said state-led investment in clean energy would be substantially cheaper than the private sector equivalent – helping to save households money on their bills. It said renewable investment financed out of Labour’s initial £8.3bn capitalisation would save between £125m and £208m a year on debt interest costs each year – saving up to £1bn in total compared with private-sector borrowing, which is typically more expensive. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion Analysis in the report was based on estimates from the International Energy Association that a 2 percentage point increase in borrowing costs can lead to a 20% increase in a solar or wind project’s “levelised cost of electricity”, a measure of the average cost of each unit of electricity generated over the lifetime of an asset. Common Wealth said this was a good proxy for the savings between government-backed investment and the private sector, which could be passed on to households in the form of cheaper bills. Mathew Lawrence, Common Wealth’s director, said: “Keir Starmer’s renewed commitment to GB Energy, Labour’s proposed new public renewables company, is welcome. However, the true test of ambition is in its design and scale. “An ambitious public renewables company like GB Energy on the scale of leading international equivalents would mean lower energy bills, good jobs in every part of the country, faster decarbonisation and energy independence for the UK - indeed it is the cornerstone of any serious attempt to transition our economy.” A Labour spokesperson said: “With Labour’s ambitious £8.3bn capitalisation of Great British Energy, we will invest in clean homegrown power that will cut energy bills, create the next generation of jobs in clean industries, and make Britain energy independent.” Explore more on these topics Energy industry Labour Keir Starmer Energy efficiency Renewable energy Energy Green politics news Share Reuse this content"

Anwar Aridi Nah-Yoon Shin Joo Sueb Lee February 13, 2024 This page in: English English English © syeols/ Shutterstock A growing number of middle-income countries are committing to net zero emissions and pledging to decouple their emissions from growth. But energy consumption, especially in emerging economies, is increasing, and the industrial sector is a leading consumer, accounting for roughly 24 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. The share of industrial emissions is especially large in many large emerging economies—including China, Viet Nam, Türkiye, Thailand, Malaysia, and Bangladesh —where the manufacturing sector accounts for more than 20 percent of GDP. Given this high level of industrial emissions, how realistic are these pledges? How can emerging economies with large manufacturing sectors achieve their net zero objectives? Energy efficiency is the most cost-effective way to meet energy and climate goals. Nevertheless, the ability to improve energy efficiency varies widely across sectors, with the energy intensity of some sectors four times that of others (figure 1). Sectors with very high energy intensity (such as cement, steel and iron, chemicals, food processing, and paper and pulp) are labeled as hard-to-abate sectors. Given these constraints, what can policy makers do? Figure 1. Korea Manufacturing Energy intensity varies widely across sectors Note: TOE = Ton of oil equivalent. KRW = Korean won. Source: Anwar Aridi, Kim Kibum, Joo Sueb Lee, Nah Yoon Shin, and Daein Kang. Lessons from Korea’s Energy Efficiency Policies in the Industrial Sector. Finance, Competitiveness and Innovation Global Practice. Washington, DC: World Bank Group. A new World Bank report— Lessons from Korea’s Energy Efficiency Policies in the Industry Sector —holds lessons for other economies. The Republic of Korea gradually started decoupling GDP growth from carbon emissions in 2009 (figure 2). The energy intensity of the manufacturing sector decreased by 44% between 2000 and 2020 , but the pace of improvement has decelerated since the 2010s. Despite these improvements, emissions from hard-to-abate sectors remained high, accounting for 75 percent of Korea’s total carbon emissions and 60 percent of national energy consumption . These structural characteristics of Korea’s economy and the limitations they impose make the country a relevant case for industrializing economies of today. Figure 2. GDP growth in the Republic of Korea has far outpaced greenhouse gas emissions Note: GDP = gross domestic product; CO2 = carbon dioxide. Source: Hoon Sahib Soh, Koh, Youngsun, and Anwar Aridi, eds. 2023. Innovative Korea: Leveraging Innovation and Technology for Development. Washington, DC: World Bank. Korea has over 40 years of experience in developing energy efficiency policies, which it began adopting after the oil shock of the 1970s. In 1979, it enacted the Energy Rationalization Use Act. Over the next 30 years, it adopted six five-year Basic Plans for the Rationalization of Energy Use. It gradually developed its energy efficiency policy mix targeting two main objectives: improving the flow of data and inducing firms to adopt energy-efficient solutions. Today, its policy mix includes a combination of mandatory approaches, such as energy efficiency standards and labeling programs and energy audit requirements for energy-intensive firms, and market-based approaches, such as emission trading schemes (ETS). The new report reviewed 17 energy efficiency policy instruments, drawing lessons from Korea's policy experience that could inform the design and implementation of energy efficiency policy in emerging economies. Three main lessons emerge: Incorporate energy intensity implications into industrial policy and economic plans, in order to avoid developing captive economic structures that constrain energy efficiency gains in the long run. K orea’s experience shows that without changing the industrial structure, the characteristics of hard-to-abate sectors make it difficult to achieve additional efficiency gains. Industrial policies and economic plans could take into consideration the energy-intensity implications of targeted industries and steer firms away from hard-to-abate toward greener sectors. Establish effective monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems, and leverage digital technologies to collect, analyze, and monitor energy data. Information asymmetry is one of the key challenges facing the adoption of energy efficiency solutions. Korea was an early promoter and adopter of smart metering, advanced sensors, and energy management systems, through which it collects data on consumption and emission and shares them two main public databases, the Korea Energy Statistical Information System (KESIS) and the National Greenhouse Gas Emission Total Information System (NETIS). Develop implementing agencies with the capabilities to design and implement a comprehensive energy efficiency policy mix. The Korea Energy Agency (KEA), the de facto implementer of energy efficiency policy in Korea, was given a clear mandate to communicate realistic targets; issue technical guidelines, methodologies, and metrics; and regularly consult with industries to reduce the uncertainties associated with sudden policy changes. If emerging economies are to achieve their net zero objectives, they need to integrate industrial energy efficiency into their policy objectives. They can learn from and avoid the mistakes of yesterday’s emerging economies by choosing green pathways rather than falling into traps encountered by the forerunners.

Troy Balderson Facebook Twitter Email Print February 13, 2024 10:07 am Facebook Twitter Email Print The COVID-19 pandemic showed us too much of the global supply chain runs through Communist China . Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s illegal invasion of Ukraine showed us too many of our European allies rely on Russian energy. Time after time, global crises serve as stark reminders that relying on hostile actors for critical resources is a recipe for disaster. For example, countries such as Germany have allowed their energy security to slip away and are now paying the price, powerless to decide their own future. Recommended Stories Trump has an opportunity to protect Syria’s ancient communities Trump will soon see that democracy promotion matters Europe’s due diligence rule is a risk for US manufacturers Since the outbreak of war in Ukraine, Germany and much of the rest of Europe have become dependent on the United States’s growing natural gas industry. Nations whose energy mix relied on Russian exports raced to divest from the Putin war machine, and President Joe Biden vowed to make sure we could provide them with what they needed. This makes the Biden administration’s most recent decision to halt new liquefied natural gas exports even more perplexing and dangerous. It is critical for the administration to change course, drop the hostile rhetoric toward domestic energy production, and embrace American energy dominance. The U.S. is blessed with abundant, reliable energy sources — enough to fuel domestic demand while also providing nations across the globe with clean, reliable energy. Domestically produced natural gas has become a cornerstone of America’s energy mix, creating thousands of high-paying jobs and helping curtail greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, according to the Energy Information Administration, the U.S. reduced emissions by more than 20% from 2005 to 2020, more than nearly any other nation in the world, while almost doubling our natural gas production. The impact in Ohio alone is remarkable. Natural gas has helped reduce carbon emissions from power generation by an astounding 38%, and a recent study found that the oil and gas industry contributed more than $55 billion to the Ohio economy in 2021. Pursuing an “all of the above approach” to energy consumption and using all available energy sources just makes sense. We must take every opportunity to reduce our dependence on foreign energy sources and reduce our vulnerability to global supply chain disruptions. It’s not enough for us simply to meet energy demands. We need to be capable of providing energy that is both reliable and affordable. According to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s most recent long-term reliability outlook, power demand in North America is growing at the fastest rate in 30 years. Over the next decade, peak summer demand will rise by over 79 gigawatts, while peak winter demand will increase by nearly 91 gigawatts. At the same time, an estimated 83 gigawatts of fossil fuels and nuclear power plants are expected to retire. To keep the lights on and avoid severe power disruptions in the future, we cannot allow policies that will force existing reliable generation into early retirement. Unfortunately, the Biden administration is actively working to add barriers to natural gas production and exportation. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER So, what must be done? First, as mentioned above, the Biden administration needs to reverse its dangerous decision to halt future LNG export projects. Second, the administration must withdraw its new methane regulations targeting American energy production and small natural gas producers. Third, Congress needs to act quickly on permitting reform, allowing for the construction of new energy infrastructure and reliable transportation of natural gas and other energy to all corners of our country from the basins where it is produced. And fourth, we need to make the necessary regulatory and policy changes to allow for a reliable electric grid to flourish, and the government should encourage natural gas-fired power generation to be a large part of this new reliable grid. Investing in American natural gas is essential for achieving energy security and severing dependence on hostile nations, and it is key for promoting economic growth and job creation. The future of American energy is right below our feet, and it’s time for our energy policy to reflect that fact. Rep. Troy Balderson has served Ohio’s 12th Congressional District since 2018. Tim Tarpley is president of the Energy Workforce & Technology Council, the national trade association for the global energy technology and services sector, representing more than 665,000 U.S. jobs in the technology-driven energy value chain.

Geothermal energy is energy from the heat of the earth that is trapped underground in hot water reservoirs. This type of energy is carbon-free and does not emit greenhouse gases. It can be used to generate electricity and also to heat buildings. The funds, from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, will fund three projects that aim to demonstrate that geothermal energy that comes from man-made reservoirs is effective and able to be used on a large scale. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The projects receiving federal funds are a Chevron New Energies project in California, a Fervo Energy project in Utah and a Mazama Energy project in Oregon. An Energy Department analysis found last year that the U.S. could get enough geothermal energy onto the grid to power 65 million homes in 2050. “These projects will help us advance geothermal power, including into regions of the country where this renewable resource has never before been used,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a written statement. She added that the pilot projects “will help us realize the full potential of the heat beneath our feet to reduce carbon emissions, create domestic jobs, and deliver clean, cost-effective, reliable energy.” For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.

""I think we postponed this [Aramco capacity] investment simply because … we're transitioning. And transitioning means that even our oil company, which used to be an oil company, became a hydrocarbon company. Now it's becoming an energy company,"" the Saudi minister said. ""Energy security in the 70s, and 80s and 90s was more dependent on oil. Now, you get what happened last year … It was gas. The future problem on energy security, it will not be oil.

Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images Saudi's state-controlled oil giant Aramco suspended its capacity expansion plans because of the green transition, Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman said Monday, stressing that the future of energy security lies with renewables. ""I think we postponed this [Aramco capacity] investment simply because … we're transitioning. And transitioning means that even our oil company, which used to be an oil company, became a hydrocarbon company. Now it's becoming an energy company,"" the Saudi prince said during a question and answer panel at the International Petroleum Technology Conference in Dhahran, noting that Aramco has investments in oil, gas, petrochemicals and renewables. On Jan. 30, the Saudi energy ministry surprised the markets with a directive instructing the Saudi majority-owned Aramco, which went public in 2019, to stop plans to increase its maximum crude production capacity from 12 million barrels per day to 13 million barrels per day by 2027. The ministry did not disclose the reason behind its decision at the time, sparking questions over potential Saudi concerns over the future of oil demand amid a progressing energy transition. The Saudi energy minister on Monday qualified the decision was not made hastily and was the product of a continuous review of market conditions. ""We are in [a] continuous mode of reviewing and reviewing and reviewing, simply because you have to view the realities [of the market],"" he said. watch now VIDEO 3:05 03:05 Saudi Arabia's directive for Aramco was 'prudent,' oil and gas consultancy says Capital Connection Oil prices have spasmed through waves of volatility in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, weighed by lower-than-expected recoveries in Chinese demand and inflationary pressures. The global movement to decarbonize and stave off a climate crisis has redirected energy companies away from long-term fossil fuel projects in favor of greener investment pastures — and may redefine the outlook for energy security, Abdulaziz bin Salman signaled on Monday. ""Energy security in the 70s, and 80s and 90s was more dependent on oil. Now, you get what happened last year … It was gas. The future problem on energy security, it will not be oil. It will be renewables. And the materials, and the mines,"" he stressed, noting that there is still a ""huge cushion"" of spare capacity available in the event of an emergency shortage. Previously, such supply shocks have struck by way of sanctions or attacks against oil infrastructure worldwide. ""Why should we be the last country to hold energy capacity, or emergency capacity, when it is not appreciated? And when it is not recognized?"" the Saudi energy minister said. ""Energy security is not just the responsibility of Saudi Arabia. It's the responsibility of all energy producers and energy ministries,"" Notably, spare capacity has also long served as a diplomatic instrument in the Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, shaping the odds of victory in the fleeting one-month price war between Riyadh and Moscow in 2020. Saudi Arabia and its OPEC allies have long championed a combined energy transition strategy that utilizes fossil fuel resources until such a time that renewable supplies are available to fully cover global requirements, downplaying concerns over markets imminently hitting peak old demand. The stance stands in staunch contrast to that of the International Energy Agency, which in a landmark report of 2021 advocated against further investment in new fossil fuel supply projects, if humanity is to combat the climate crisis. Yet Middle East countries have increasingly attempted to reconcile their image as stalwart fossil fuel producers with their energy transition ambitions, with key OPEC producer the United Arab Emirates hosting last year's U.N. climate-geared Conference of the Parties (COP). The world's largest crude exporter, Saudi Arabia aims to decarbonize by 2060, with Saudi Aramco targeting to reach operational net-zero emissions by 2050. Steered by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 plan, the kingdom has also been grappling with diversifying its economy away from overreliance on fossil fuels."

And while energy consumers are more interested than ever in sustainability and the potential of a clean energy future, 70% say they won't spend more time or money to take action. Consumer fatigue is setting in, stalling confidence, and stagnating progress says EY in the 'Energy transition consumer insights' report. Greg Guthridge, EY Global Energy & Resources Customer Experience Transformation Leader, says: ""Consumer apprehension comes as we enter a new - more difficult - phase of the energy transition, all while dealing with higher energy prices, geopolitical volatility, and growing concerns around energy equity. While efforts on the supply side are gaining momentum, we need an even more fundamental shift in how we engage and encourage sustainable consumer behavior. Energy consumers want a clean energy future but need a broad range of support to make personal energy choices. Closing the gap between their interest and action will depend on energy providers, government, and the broader energy ecosystem working together to pull every lever available."" Consumers lose faith in the ""three As"" of energy Over three years, EY surveyed nearly 100,000 residential energy consumers across 21 markets, with the latest insight revealing consumers are less confident in their energy future than they were a year ago. Many say the energy system just isn't delivering on the three fundamental aspects of the energy experience: affordability, access, and appeal. Only 30% of consumers are confident that their energy will remain affordable and 72% state they can't absorb a bill increase of 10%. Moreover, while 26% of consumers have a good understanding of terms such as renewable energy and sustainability, this figure has not improved over the last three years. The findings also show that consumers are diverse - and often irrational - being driven by a wide range of energy values. Creating 'appeal' means understanding the complicated drivers of human behavior. Of those surveyed, 77% want their energy provider to offer low-cost energy options alongside high-end products and services. Additionally, 67% seek personalized energy solutions and 18% of consumers would adopt new energy products and services if it was easier to purchase and install them. Guthridge says: ""Change is accelerating exponentially across the world's multiple energy transitions. Disruption to the energy industry is increasing. And at the heart of this is the consumer. The EY research shows consumers are interested about the potential of change but want partners to help."" ""This creates an opportunity for energy providers to reshape themselves as trusted advisors -making change easier, faster, broader, and deeper. A holistic, consumer-centric approach to the energy transition is how we accelerate progress toward a fairer, greener, and better energy system that delivers more value for everyone.""

https://www.uswitch.com/gas-electricity/suppliers/octopus-energy/,,"Octopus Energy Reviews , Prices & Tariffs",20240208T014500Z,,uswitch.com,English,United Kingdom,XLE,Energy,energy,"Octopus Energy tariffs, prices, reviews and other information One of the most popular and innovative energy suppliers in the UK, Octopus Energy entered the UK energy market in 2016, using technology to create a leaner business from the ground up and ensure future room to grow. Why choose Octopus Energy? Octopus Energy has grown significantly since its foundation, largely thanks to acquiring the customers of other suppliers that have gone bust, notably Bulb, which had 1.5 million customers when it went into administration, and Shell Energy, which sold its customer base to Octopus when Shell exited the UK retail energy market. Octopus is now the biggest energy supplier in the UK, supplying 24% of electricity customers and 24.1% of gas customers as of the end of 2024. The supplier has also invested heavily in energy efficiency measures along with green energy and electric vehicle infrastructure, as well as expanding operations outside the UK to places as far away as Texas. Octopus Energy also won top prize in Uswitch's 2025 Energy Awards with its customers voting it the best supplier for Overall Customer Satisfaction. It also won the top prize in the 2024 awards. In 2025, it came top in the Best Customer Service category and shared the top spot for Best Value For Money. Varied range of tariffs Extensive products and services offered outside energy supply Award-winning customer service Commitment to renewable energy supply and generation How do I contact Octopus Energy? Emails and calls to Octopus Energy are answered by UK-based energy specialists, with average call wait times under a minute. Octopus has a wide range of guides and FAQ answers on its site, but in the event that you still need to talk to somebody, you can contact its team using the following methods: Phone: 0808 164 1088 (Monday-Thursday 9am-5pm, Friday 9am-4pm) Email: hello@octopus.energy If you want support for heat pumps, solar panels or EV chargers, you can call 0808 164 1088. You can also use a free SignVideo service with BSL interpreters Monday-Thursday 9am-5pm and Friday 9am-4pm. What tariffs are offered by Octopus Energy? Octopus Energy has a vast range of energy tariffs on offer - at the time of writing, there were 72 available to switch to (across domestic, business, credit and prepayment options). It offers fixed rate and variable tariffs where unit rates are fixed or variable according to the level of the energy price cap. Fixed tariffs are popular with those wanting price certainty over a year or more, while variable tariffs could be the cheapest option for many customers in the wake of the wholesale energy market crisis. Other Octopus Energy tariffs include the Tracker tariff, which is based on the daily wholesale price of energy, and the Agile Octopus tariff, which has half-hourly rates. The Octopus Go Tariff is a time-of-use tariff designed especially for households with an electric vehicle, offering cheaper night rates to help make charging more affordable. Does Octopus charge exit fees? Octopus charges exit fees on business tariffs but doesn’t tend to do so on domestic tariffs. Customers should check whether exit fees apply to their tariff before they sign up. Octopus Energy reviews 2025 Octopus Energy has a TrustPilot score of 4.8 from over 612,000 reviews , as of June 2025. Most reviews are overwhelmingly positive, with 90% of the total reviews rating the supplier at the maximum of five stars. Can I get a smart meter with Octopus? You can get a smart meter with Octopus. They make thousands of appointments available across the country each week, though they may not be in your area immediately. Customers can register their interest and then be notified when appointments are available in their area. Does Octopus Energy offer energy efficiency products? As mentioned above, Octopus offers smart meters but also products like smart meters and heat pumps, along with specific electric vehicle charging tariffs. These can be combined with “smart tariffs” that offer lower energy rates at certain times to help customers use energy more efficiently and bring their bills down. Octopus Energy 2024 customer rating In the 2024 Uswitch Energy Awards , Octopus Energy scooped the Overall Customer Satisfaction prize and came second in the Best Customer Service and Best Value For Money categories. As these awards are voted for by customers, Octopus's successes here reflect the high regard its customers have for it as a supplier. Frequently asked questions Does Octopus offer renewable energy? All Octopus energy tariffs offer 100% renewable electricity, with energy needs met by clean, green sources like solar and wind power. To reduce carbon footprints even further, Octopus can offset the carbon emissions from the gas customers use for a few pounds extra each month. In the last year alone, 26,900 tonnes of CO2 have been saved from entering the atmosphere thanks to customers choosing Octopus’ low-carbon energy over an average standard tariff. That's roughly the same climate impact as planting 365 trees for each and every Octopus Energy customer. Does Octopus Energy have an app? Octopus Energy has an app which acts as a way for customers to manage their energy on the go. Similarly to logging in to an account on a computer, customers are able to see their latest usage and statements, make payments and get help with any problems they're having. Octopus Energy customers have access to an online account, with features from editing Direct Debit amounts and dates, to entering a meter reading, to managing email and account preferences, requesting a credit refund, and booking a smart meter installation. Which providers are similar to Octopus Energy? Octopus’s size and range of tariffs and products offered mean it isn’t really comparable to any other providers. Other members of the big six - British Gas, EDF, E.ON, OVO and ScottishPower - would be the closest alternatives to it. How do I cancel my Octopus Energy supply? If you want to cancel your Octopus Energy supply, you simply need to switch to a new supplier. However, remember that you could end up having to pay exit fees if you’re on a fixed term tariff and haven’t entered the final 49 days of the contract. If you’re on a variable tariff, you’ll be free to switch away at any time. Is Octopus Energy going bust? It’s extremely unlikely that Octopus Energy is going to go bust given its size. However, the energy market remains challenging and unpredictable at the moment, and there is a certain level of risk to some suppliers - find out why in our energy market Q&A guide .
