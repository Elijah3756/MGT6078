How is the tech industry thinking about AI's environmental impact? By Emily Kwong , Avery Keatley , Rebecca Ramirez , Megan Lim Published March 30, 2025 at 5:03 PM EDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Listen • 11:14 EMILY KWONG, HOST: Perhaps you have played around with artificial intelligence or have seen AI woven into your favorite apps. AI infrastructure is a big priority under the Trump administration, and tech companies are investing heavily. It's an exciting field, one that captured Sasha Luccioni. In 2018, she started a new job - AI researcher at Morgan Stanley. She was excited to learn something new in the field of AI but couldn't shake this worry. SASHA LUCCIONI: I, essentially, was getting more and more climate anxiety. I was really feeling this profound disconnect between my job and my values and the things that I cared about. And so, essentially, I was like, oh, I should quit my job and go plant trees. I should - you know, I should do something that's really making a difference in the world. And then my partner was like, well, you have a Ph.D. in AI. Maybe you can use that to make a difference in the world. KWONG: So Luccioni quit her job and joined a growing movement to make AI more sustainable. Since 2022, AI has boomed, and it's caused a surge in energy consumption. Tech companies are racing to build data centers to keep up - these huge buildings filled with hundreds of thousands of computers that require a lot of energy. By 2028, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory forecasts the data centers could consume as much as 12% of the nation's electricity. And AI is also leading a surge in water consumption. It's a concern echoed all over social media. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: The amount of water that AI uses is astonishing. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: AI needs water. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: A lot of people are saying that every time you use ChatGPT... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: ChatGPT uses this much water for 100-word emails. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: And where will that water come from? KWONG: And the four big data center operators with a growing water and carbon footprint are Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta. And to be clear, all four of those are among NPR's financial supporters and pay to distribute some of our content. BENJAMIN LEE: Before generative AI came along in late 2022, there was hope among these data center operators that they could go to net-zero. KWONG: Benjamin Lee studies computer architecture at the University of Pennsylvania. Generative AI refers to the AI that uses large language models. LEE: So I don't see how you can - under current infrastructure investment plans, you could possibly achieve those net-zero goals. KWONG: And data center construction is only going to increase. On January 21, the day after his second inauguration, President Trump announced a private joint venture to build 20 large data centers across the country, as heard here on NBC. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: A new American company that will invest $500 billion at least in AI infrastructure in the United States and very quickly, moving very rapidly. KWONG: This new project, known as Stargate, would together consume 15 gigawatts of power. That would be like 15 new Philadelphia-sized cities consuming energy. So how is the industry thinking about its future and its environmental footprint? The four cloud giants - Google, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon - all have climate goals, goals for hitting net-zero carbon emissions - most by 2030, Amazon by 2040. And there's a few ways they can get there. Let's start with a very popular energy source for big tech, nuclear, because Amazon, Meta and Alphabet, which runs Google, just signed an agreement, along with other companies, that supports tripling the global nuclear supply by 2050. And along with Microsoft, these four companies have signed agreements to purchase nuclear energy, an industry that has been stagnant for years. Microsoft has committed to buying power from an old nuclear plant on Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. You may remember that was the site of a partial nuclear meltdown in 1979, and NPR's Nina Totenberg talked to kids in the Harrisburg area right after. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) NINA TOTENBERG: You know what evacuation is? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: That everybody has to go. NINA TOTENBERG: Do you know why? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Because of radioactivity. KWONG: While some radioactive gas was released, thankfully it wasn't enough to cause serious health effects. And Microsoft now wants to build this nuclear site back. In a way, AI companies are turning into energy brokers. But my science desk colleague, Geoff Brumfiel, sees a discrepancy in this between the AI people and the nuclear energy people. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: These are just two super different engineering cultures, you know? And the way I've come to think about it is Silicon Valley loves to go fast and break things. The nuclear industry has to move very, very, very slowly because nothing can ever break. KWONG: Because of accidents like Three Mile Island, Geoff says that nothing in the nuclear industry ever happens quickly. It's also extremely expensive. And while solar and wind energy, combined with batteries, is quicker to build and more inexpensive than nuclear or gas-power plants, it still takes time to build, and there are problems hooking up new energy sources to the grid. So in the meantime, many data centers will continue to use fossil fuels. But there's another solution here, and that's to make data centers themselves more efficient through better hardware, better chips and more efficient cooling systems. One of the most innovative methods on the rise is liquid cooling - basically, running a synthetic fluid through the hottest parts of the server to take the heat away or immersing whole servers in a cool bath. It's the same idea as running coolant through your car engine and a much faster way to cool off a hot computer. Here's Benjamin Lee again, at UPenn. LEE: And as you can imagine, it's much more efficient because now you're just cooling the surface of whatever the cold plate is covering rather than just blowing air through the entire machine. KWONG: One of the biggest providers of liquid cooling is Iceotope. David Craig is their recently retired CEO and based in the U.K. DAVID CRAIG: I definitely come from the point of view that, you know, we literally have just one planet, and I cannot understand why anybody would want to do anything other than care for it. KWONG: Craig says that the older way of cooling data centers - basically, there's lots of methods, but it's a daisy chain of moving heat with air and water - is consumptive. With liquid cooling, a lot of the heat stays in the system, and computers don't have these massive swings in temperature. CRAIG: It's not got a constant thermal shock. It's got less vibration from fans and stuff like that, so things last longer. And then, what we're doing is we're capturing that heat in a closed water loop. KWONG: Liquid cooling, however, is expensive, which makes it hard to scale. But Iceotope has announced public partnerships with Hewlett-Packard and Intel, and a spokesperson at Meta told me they anticipate some of the company's liquid cooling-enabled data centers will be up and running by 2026. Throughout my many emails and seven hours of phone conversations with spokespersons at Amazon, Google and Microsoft, too, there was one innovation they were quiet about, and it's the one that scientists and engineers outside of big tech were most excited about. And that is smaller AI models, ones good enough to complete a lot of the tasks we care about but in a much less energy-intensive way. Basically, a third and final solution to AI's climate problem is using less AI. One major disruptor in this space is DeepSeek, the chatbot out of a company in China claiming to use less energy. We reached out to them for comment, but they did not reply. You see, large language models, like ChatGPT, are often trained using large datasets, say, by feeding the model over a million hours of YouTube content. But DeepSeek was trained by data from other language models. Benjamin Lee at UPenn says this is called a mixture of experts. LEE: The whole idea behind a mixture of expert is, you don't need a single, huge model with a trillion parameters to answer every possible question under the sun. But rather, you would like to have a collection of experts, smaller models, and then you just sort of route the request to the right expert. And because each expert is so much smaller, it's going to cost less energy to invoke. KWONG: Even though DeepSeek was trained more efficiently this way, other scientists I spoke to pointed out it's still a big model, and Sasha Luccioni at Hugging Face wants to walk away from those entirely. LUCCIONI: Since ChatGPT came out, people were like, oh, we want general purpose models. We want models that can do everything at once - answer questions and write recipes and poetry and whatever. But nowadays, more and more, I think companies especially are like, well, actually, for our intents and purposes, we want to do X, like - whatever - summarize PDFs. KWONG: What Sasha is talking about are small language models, which have far fewer parameters and are trained for a specific task. And some tech companies are experimenting with this. Last year, Meta announced a smaller quantized version of some of their models. Microsoft announced a family of small models called Phi-3. A spokesperson for Amazon said they're open to considering a number of models that can meet their customers' needs. And a spokesperson for Google said they did not have a comment about small language models at this time. So meanwhile, the race to build infrastructure for large language models is very much underway. Here's Kevin Miller, who runs global infrastructure at Amazon Web Services. KEVIN MILLER: I think you have to look at the wo... [truncated]

Advertisement The all-stock deal announced on Friday consolidates two of Musk’s multiple portfolio companies, which also include Tesla and SpaceX, and potentially eases the billionaire’s ability to train his AI model known as Grok. Including US$12 billion in debt, the deal is valued at US$45 billion. “The choice of US$45 billion is not a coincidence,” said D.A. Davidson & Co. analyst Gil Luria. “It is US$1 billion higher than the take-private transaction for Twitter in 2022” and he can share the value of the xAI business with Twitter co-investors. Musk announced the transaction in a post on social media, saying that the combined entity would be valued at US$80 billion. “xAI and X’s futures are intertwined,” Musk said. “Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent.” 01:18 Trump: Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek’s strong showing a ‘wake-up call’ for US tech sector Trump: Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek’s strong showing a ‘wake-up call’ for US tech sector Neither X nor xAI spokespersons immediately responded to a request for comment.

It is often said that one's daily habits have a profound effect on one's success in life, and rightly so. Our habits often shape us into the person we become in the long run. Similarly, successful billionaires like Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and others have distinct patterns in their habits that set them apart from others. While luck and opportunity play a role, their daily practices, decision-making approaches, and resilience have been key to their success. If you too, want to be successful like them, then here we share some of their common habits that you can follow: 2 / 6 Lifelong learning One of the most common habits among most billionaires is their eagerness to learn. Be it Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Elon Musk, or Jeff Bezos-- they all are known to be voracious readers. Bill Gates reads roughly 50 books a year, while Warren Buffett spends 80% of his day reading. Elon Musk, who is largely self-taught in rocket science, also credits books for much of his knowledge. Reading has many benefits-- like expanding one's knowledge, thinking, creativity, and enhancing decision-making. 3 / 6 Taking calculated risks Successful billionaires don’t shy away from taking calculated risks in life. For example, Jeff Bezos took a huge risk when he left his stable job to start Amazon, but he assessed the market potential before taking a leap of faith. Similarly, Elon Musk is known for taking risks by implementing different work ethics at his companies. In the case of his companies, Tesla and SpaceX, Musk took a risk of investing nearly all his money into the companies at a time when they were on the brink of failure. So, one can learn to step out of their comfort zone if they want extraordinary success in life. 4 / 6 Work ethics and discipline Success doesn’t come to any without relentless effort. And successful billionaires are known for their incredible work ethic. While Elon Musk is known to work around 80-100 hours a week to push his companies forward, Bill Gates, too, spent his years working tirelessly in Microsoft during its early days. While work-life balance is important, successful people often prioritise their goals above everything else, ensuring they outwork and outperform others. They are focused, hardworking, disciplined, and resilient-- qualities that make them stand apart from others. 5 / 6 Resilience and learning from mistakes For most people, achieving success is not a straight graph. Making mistakes and failure are inevitable parts of success; however, what matters most is how you bounce back and stay committed to your goal. Billionaires understand this better than anyone, and that's what makes them so successful. For instance, Steve Jobs was once fired from Apple, only to return stronger and revolutionise the tech industry. Elon Musk’s early SpaceX launches were failures, but with consistent efforts and improvisation, it achieved historic success. Successful billionaires don't let their failures define them. Instead, they learn from their mistakes and move on in life. 6 / 6 Thinking big Instead of focusing on short-term goals, successful billionaires make long-term plans and work on them. For example, Elon Musk envisions a future where humans colonise Mars, Jeff Bezos aims to expand beyond Earth with Blue Origin, and Bill Gates continues to tackle global health challenges through his philanthropic work. These billionaires know that long-term goals and patience are the keys to success. Follow Us On Social Media Photostories What happens if you cut sugar for two weeks?

Command Line Policy Tech Elon Musk pressured Reddit’s CEO on content moderation Reddit took action after Musk messaged CEO Steve Huffman about users blocking X links and threatening DOGE staffers. Reddit took action after Musk messaged CEO Steve Huffman about users blocking X links and threatening DOGE staffers. by Alex Heath Mar 27, 2025, 3:12 PM UTC Link Share Elon Musk and Steve Huffman. Image: Getty Images / The Verge Alex Heath is a contributing writer and author of the Sources newsletter. Nearly two months ago, Elon Musk went on a public crusade against Reddit. On X, he said it was “insane” that subreddits were blocking links to the platform in protest of him appearing to give a Nazi salute. A few days later, he posted that Reddit users advocating for violence against Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employees had “broken the law.” As it turns out, Musk wasn’t only using his X platform to call out content on Reddit. He was also privately messaging Reddit CEO Steve Huffman , according to people familiar with the matter. Shortly after the two CEOs exchanged text messages, Reddit enacted a 72-hour ban on the “WhitePeopleTwitter” subreddit that hosted the thread about DOGE employees, citing the “prevalence of violent content.” The specific thread Musk shared on X was also deleted, including hundreds of comments that didn’t call for violence or doxxing. (So far, Reddit doesn’t appear to have intervened in any moderator decisions to ban X links from the subreddits they oversee.) When asked about Musk and Huffman’s correspondence, Reddit spokesperson Gina Antonini sent the following statement: “We take any report of Reddit policy violations seriously, whether on Reddit directly or through other public or private means. We will evaluate content reported to us and take action if violating.” Musk didn’t respond to a request for comment. The news of Musk’s outreach to Huffman quickly made its way to some of Reddit’s moderators, who discussed it together on Discord. After one wrote, “Musk is coming for /r/Comics,” which was one of the subreddits that was banning links to X, another responded by calling him a “giant baby,” according to screenshots of the conversation that were shared with me. (Since he bought Twitter, Musk has blocked links to competitors multiple times , including as recently as last month .) “Elon called out death threats,” wrote another Reddit moderator. “He should not be able to influence Reddit, but if what he calls out is death threats then of course they need to come down.” Yet another responded: “Oh, I don’t have any problem with removing rule-breaking content (and taking the respective admin action on said accounts), but I find it a bit problematic that he’s able to exert influence on both public and private institutions.” Elsewhere AI’s Wild West era: ChatGPT’s upgraded image generation feels like an important milestone in the AI industry’s shift toward a more Wild West, hands-off style of moderation. OpenAI’s stance that public figures should opt out of having their likeness replicated — not to mention ChatGPT’s willingness to replicate specific brands — feels inherently problematic. It also gives other players cover to do the same. TikTok is losing Blake Chandlee , the ex-Facebook leader who essentially built its ads business from scratch, with the deadline for it to be saved from a US ban or not hitting next Saturday . Chandlee’s departure is notable, though I’m more interested in TikTok chief Shou Chew’s internal memo about his replacement. TikTok’s ad sales org, which Chandlee oversaw, will be merged with the revenue product org led by Will Liu , a seven-year ByteDance veteran. And according to Chew’s memo, Liu will now report to him with a “dotted line” to Lidong Zhang , the chair of the company’s business in mainland China. If I’m ByteDance, that’s a strange org chart change to make if you think you’re about to lose control of TikTok… More headlines: 23andMe filed for bankruptcy … More layoffs hit Block … Robinhood moved into banking… Google tried to upstage OpenAI with a Gemini update … Apple’s WWDC keynote will be on June 9th. Job board Some noteworthy job changes in the tech world: Another personnel change at TikTok, per Chew’s internal note: Khartoon Weiss is now overseeing the entire North American business. Jun Young-hyun is now the sole CEO of Samsung after Han Jong-hee tragically died of a heart attack. OpenAI promoted Mark Chen to chief research officer and Julia Villagra to chief people officer. COO Brad Lightcap will now “oversee OpenAI’s business and day-to-day operations,” which suggests that Sam Altman is focusing on some big-picture swings. X’s head of engineering and product, Haofei Wang , has left without explanation. Dan Neary , Meta’s head of Asia Pacific, is leaving the company after 12 years.

Title: Why are tech stocks so volatile ?

Article Content:
Why are tech stocks so volatile? 27 March 2025 Share Save Jonty Bloom Business reporter Share Save Getty Images Shares in chipmaker Nvidia have fallen since the start of this year We have all heard of carmaker Ford, but what about its one-time rivals Abbot-Detroit, Acme, Adams and Aerocar? No? Well that is hardly surprising because unlike Ford they all went bust very early on. And they are just some of the failed car companies starting with the letter "A". We only remember the winners who went on to dominate the world's motor industry, and the current high-tech sector is much the same. A great many investors backed the wrong horseless carriages around a century ago and lost their money. Only a few picked Ford or Chrysler, which is almost exactly what is happening now, only to the tech sector. Tech shares have been hugely volatile over the past year, as has been widely reported, with share price graphs often looking like rollercoaster rides, even before President Trump's tariffs have caused wider stocks falls. Nvidia shares sink as Chinese AI app spooks markets Tesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon Musk US tech firms feel pinch from China tariffs A principle reason for this tech sector volatility, according to Elroy Dimson, professor of finance at the University of Cambridge, is that like the once nascent car industry we don't know which tech firms will win in the long run. "If you go back to the beginning of the last century there were an awful lot of motor companies, and it was clear that automobiles were going to make a huge difference," says Prof Dimson. "But almost every company went bankrupt, you didn't know which company you should be buying." Then, of course, not all high-tech businesses are making money. The measure of the return on an investment in shares uses two factors, the growth in profits or dividends, and the growth in the value of the shares. Boring companies might pay reliable dividends and see their shares gradually increase in value. But many high-tech companies are not paying out much if anything in dividends. Instead, they are investing in future growth, and so their share prices fluctuate based on hopes of future profits. As Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at UK financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, puts it: "Tech shares are more volatile, they have high valuations and their price-earnings ratios are very high, and growth stocks are more sensitive to interest rate movements." But also, investors in such shares are, as Ms Streeter puts it, gambling on "not jam today but jam tomorrow". They are all trying to pick the next future big winner, not the one paying out profits now, but the one that will eventually pay huge dividends sometime in the future. So, any news or even suggestion that future growth is not going to be as good as previously expected means share values can collapse. Susannah Streeter Susannah Streeter says that tech stocks are always a gamble for investors On the other hand, any good news boosts share prices even if current profits, or even losses, don't change at all, as investors pile into what they think is the future winner. The shares are more volatile because they are not underwritten by current profits or dividends. That means as Prof Dimson puts it, "that small changes in growth expectation can lead to large changes in share value", which can effect a large number of companies at the same time. "You have companies that are reasonably similar, so when growth rates change it is effecting quite a few companies in a similar way," he says. "This is not different from the dotcom boom at the beginning of the 2000s. There were companies with huge growth prospects. And when the growth prospects disappeared, these were the companies that disappeared." Also, even today there are not that many really large high-tech companies. In America they are colloquially known as the "magnificent seven" - Nvidia, a chipmaker, Alphabet, which owns Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, the parent of Facebook, and Tesla. So, it does not take much to spook the market, especially since several of these firms are really quite young, and are dominant in sectors where previous leaders have crashed and burned. Anyone remember Ericsson, Boo or Compaq? Technology, unlike say steel production or food manufacturing, is changing at a very rapid rate, and there is obviously the chance that a new high-tech company will come along and destroy the business model of its most established rivals. There is simply no guarantee that today's "magnificent seven" will remain magnificent or even stay as the same seven firms. Take Tesla for example, its sales have recently fallen in response to two widely-reported factors. Firstly, some potential customers are opposed to Tesla owner Elon Musk's involvement in President Trump's government. And secondly, Chinese electric car firms such as BYD are increasingly strong competitors. Meanwhile, Nvidia saw its share price drop sharply at the start of this year following the release of Chinese artificial intelligence chatbot DeepSeek. This app was reportedly created at a fraction of the cost of its rivals. The instant popularity of DeepSeek has raised questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning. This concerns Nvidia because it is at the forefront of making microchips for AI processing. Getty Images Tesla's share price has been hit by both protests against the brand, and increased competition from Chinese rivals AI is now the biggest tech game in town, and it seems that absolutely everyone is claiming that AI is transforming their industry, their products and their profits. They can't all be right. Or as Prof Dimon puts it: "At least in 1910 you knew what automobiles did, but today with AI companies you have to rely on the wisdom of the crowd, and for AI companies that isn't good enough." And not all AI firms can win, adds Robert Whaley, professor of finance at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. "AI is certainly contributing to tech volatility. The race is on." That means that AI shares are sensitive to predictions. And any sign that a particular firm is lagging in the AI race may mean that lots of investors, most of whom don't understand the subject, abandon it for another that seems to be further ahead. Then there are investors who seemingly don't seem to care which companies' shares they buy, so long as they are in the "booming" high-tech sector, as they are speculating and spreading their risks. In short, share prices are not always a rational measure of a firm's value, especially in the high-tech sector, or even of its prospects. Instead, they can represent the optimism of investors. And optimism does not always last. It is often short-lived, passing, and faddish. And sometimes optimism comes face to face with reality or just plain fades away. It is, in short, volatile.

Question of the Day How many tech workers have quit due to inflexible workplace policies? Answer: 40 percent. March 25, 2025 • News Staff Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Print Email The tech sector has been hit with more return-to-office mandates and other stringent requirements, such as asking employees to work longer hours. But nearly half of them are just not having it. According to data from Randstad, a recruitment company based in Amsterdam, 2 in 5 workers in the technology sector said they left their positions in the last year due to their employers’ working requirements. The survey queried more than 26,000 staff in 35 markets, 2,548 of whom worked in technology. Those who reported leaving over inflexible work policies cited return-to-office mandates, increased time requirements and increased “intensity of work” as reasons for leaving. Additionally, 56 percent said they threatened to seek alternatives if their company ignored or denied their requests for more flexibility. Nearly three-quarters of tech-sector respondents answered that they believe remote work increases a “sense of community” with colleagues. This is higher than the average of 58 percent who said the same in other sectors, suggesting remote work is valued highly among tech workers. And 68 percent of tech employees said they trust their employer more if they’re more easygoing on working hours, intensity of work and where employees work.

Issued by KnowBe4 Johannesburg, 25 Mar 2025 The Africa Human Risk Management Survey 2025. (Image: KnowBe4) Preliminary results from the Red Ribbon Insights Africa-wide Human Risk Management Survey have already highlighted very unexpected realities faced by cyber security decision-makers on the continent. Yet, the real take-away is how valuable targeted, industry-specific surveying is for identifying how trends differ across regions. Red Ribbon Insights, the newly launched surveying and market research division of Red Ribbon Communications, recently started gathering responses from top cyber security decision-makers in Africa to understand the unique human risk landscape they face. The Africa Human Risk Management Survey 2025 is sponsored by KnowBe4 Africa, the renowned cyber security platform that addresses comprehensive human risk management. The value of putting Africa first One of the most striking trends emerging from responses so far is how much faith CISOs and security awareness leads are placing in the tech professionals they employ, without hedging against potential issues. Senior cyber security managers across Africa have submitted survey responses that show something unexpected: the tech industry itself seems to be where the biggest disconnect between cyber security awareness and responsible practices lies. Respondents in the tech industry report the second lowest rate of having defined processes for employees to report security incidents within their organisations – a rate topped by seven out of eight other surveyed industries. However, these same tech industry respondents report that their employees have very high levels of awareness about their organisations’ cyber security policies and procedures. This may indicate a trend where tech employees have very high levels of awareness of cyber security policies, procedures and threats, but aren’t subjected to as much formal reporting or device management processes as in other industries. The importance of catering to uniqueness Africa’s tech industry is burgeoning, but key traits of the cyber security environment these organisations operate in remain unexplored due to many generalisations or unspecific focuses on the distinct factors at play in the unique space organisations operate in on the continent. It is only through inputs from targeted respondents in targeted industries that are in a targeted area or environment where actionable insights can be sourced that add new dynamics to conventional understandings. Red Ribbon Insights is the industry research division of Red Ribbon Communications . Red Ribbon Insights helps companies unlock exclusive, high-quality data they can use to fuel powerful PR and marketing campaigns . Exclusive research is one of the most effective ways to build trust, back up claims, and create content that resonates with target audiences. Ready to make data work for you?

Share: Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Share using Native tools Share Copied to clipboard Follow Us On Discover Make Us Preferred In Top Stories Computer programming was once a foolproof field—one of those career paths that was always going to need workers, like accounting and nursing. The industry has taken a severe downturn in recent years, specifically the past two years, wherein a quarter of all computer programming jobs have disappeared. There are currently fewer programmers in the United States today than at any point since 1980, reports The Washington Post . Videos by VICE What’s especially odd is that software developers, a cousin of computer programming , are doing just fine. Programming jobs have declined by 27.5 percent, at the same time software developer roles only dropped by 0.3 percent. People often use the two terms interchangeably though they are different fields. This begs the question: what meaningful differences are there between the two jobs that can account for the eradication of one and the relative stability of the other? AI Chatbots Are Taking Computer Programming Jobs AI chatbots. The decline in computer programming roles almost perfectly lines up with the rise of AI chatbots entering the American workforce. AI systems like ChatGPT can generate code with minimal input and can perform a lot of the routine tasks traditionally performed by programmers, and a fraction of the time and for significantly less money. Automation comes for us all, though The Washington Post’s Andrew Van Dam argues that more often than not AI is used to augment and supplement the human worker rather than fully replace them. Another factor that can be seen across careers throughout the tech industry regardless of the specific field is the broader economic factors affecting the entire tech industry. The tech job market has cooled quite a bit after the pandemic boom, and high interest rates have convinced executives that they need to cut jobs to maintain overhead. It doesn’t seem like AI is going to fully replace computer programming soon, and it may never, but computer programming was the kind of job people who needed a lucrative career shift could quickly learn how to get themselves moving in a new direction in life. And now AI is encroaching on that territory, slowly chipping away at a once reliable offramp.

South and West India lead in CSR spending, tech firms exceed 2% mandate: Report ANI | Updated: Mar 22, 2025 14:38 IST ANI News Join our Whatsapp channel New Delhi [India], March 22 (ANI): South and West India have witnessed more Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR ) spending by the technology companies in India compared to other regions, with more companies spending beyond the mandate of 2 per cent, according to a report prepared jointly by Nasscom and BOD Consulting. The report added that the leading areas of spending for major tech companies are in education (38.4 per cent) followed by environment and climate change (25.5 percent) and skilling (16 per cent). Education, Healthcare, Poverty Eradication-Hunger Malnutrition, Environment and Sustainability were the leading segments where projects were initiated by the tech industry, the report observed. According to the report, about 83 per cent tech companies reported more than 2 per cent of their profits being allocated to CSR in FY23. This was much higher than the 65 percent reported for non-tech companies. "India's tech industry is elevating corporate social responsibility into a transformative force for large-scale impact. Our findings reveal that in FY23, tech companies led 2,610 CSR projects, contributing 23 percent of total CSR spending, with 83 percent exceeding the mandated 2 percent allocation. Notably, 65 per cent of initiatives are today tech-driven, using AI-powered monitoring, online learning platforms, and advanced skilling programs to create lasting impact in education, jobs, and sustainability," said Saurabh Uboweja, Founder and Managing Partner, BOD Consulting. He further added, "Beyond regulatory compliance, businesses are proactively linking CSR with national agendas and the UN SDGs. Also, the path ahead lies in stronger collaboration, data-led implementation, and scaling inclusive models to elevate communities so that technology-enabled CSR keeps driving India's growth in a sustainable and impactful manner." As per the observation of the report, companies involved in CSR activity grew by 22 per cent in the Financial Year F(Y23) over FY22. Total spending on CSR increased by 13 per cent in FY23 over FY22, as per the report. As per the observation, the companies spending more than 2 per cent of profits increased from 64 percent to 74 per cent in FY23 over FY19. According to the data, about 75 leading tech companies spent Rs 5,443 Crores on CSR in FY23 while more than 80 percent tech companies crossed the mandated 2 per cent benchmark. A total of 2,610 CSR projects by the 75 major tech companies were undertaken in FY23, the report adds. Going forward, the report highlighted that despite significant progress, challenges persist in ensuring equitable geographic distribution of CSR spending, focusing on aspirational districts, and fostering deeper NGO collaborations.

A total of 2,610 CSR projects by the 75 major tech companies were undertaken in FY23, the report adds. Going forward, the report highlighted that despite significant progress, challenges persist in ensuring equitable geographic distribution of CSR spending, focusing on aspirational districts, and fostering deeper NGO collaborations.

Stock heatmap by FinViz.com Fri, 21 Mar 2025 14:46:03 GMT Sector Overview The present stock market heatmap reveals a diverse range of sector performances across the board, influencing today's trading landscape notably. Key sectors such as Technology and Industrials are making waves with contrasting movements. 📉 Technology Sector: The technology sector is dominated by a wave of red, indicating underperformance. Notably, Nvidia (NVDA) has plunged by 1.74%, reflecting ongoing struggles within the semiconductor space. 🚀 Industrials: In contrast, the industrial sector is showing robust performance, driven by defense stocks like Lockheed Martin (LMT) , which has soared by 2.53%. This sector appears to be benefitting from increased government contracts and strategic defense acquisitions. 🏦 Financials: The financial sector displays mixed fortunes with major players such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) slightly down by 0.20%. This signals caution among investors amidst lingering economic uncertainties. Market Mood and Trends The broader market sentiment is veering towards caution, primarily influenced by the tech sector's underperformance. Bearish trends in prominent semiconductor companies are contributing to uncertainties. However, the resilience in industrials, particularly in defense, is creating a buffer for the overall market. This behavioral divergence signifies an ongoing strategic shift among investors, who may be transitioning from high-risk tech stocks to more stable industrials and defensive plays, anticipating macroeconomic developments. Strategic Recommendations Given current trends, investors and traders at ForexLive might contemplate reassessing their portfolio allocations. Here are some actionable suggestions: Diversification: Consider expanding into sectors like Industrials and Healthcare , which show resilience amidst broader market volatility. Keeping an eye on defense stocks could prove beneficial. Watch for Catalysts: Stay alert for any positive news from the tech sector that could stimulate a rebound, especially in semiconductors. Upcoming earnings reports will be critical in gauging future trajectories. Risk Management: Be cautious with heavily tech-weighted portfolios unless there is a compelling reason to anticipate a sector recovery. Diversifying risk across sectors remains a prudent strategy. The current market environment highlights the importance of staying informed and agile. Regularly checking real-time data and continuing to visit ForexLive.com for comprehensive market analyses will aid in navigating these uncertain times effectively.

Why China's stock market is roaring after investors fled in 2024 Filip De Mott March 15, 2025 5 min read China's stock market is suddenly surging after a tough time in 2024. A pro-tech shift from Beijing is spurring confidence in markets. While economic challenges persist, sources say the government is correcting course. China looks investible again. The country's stocks are rallying, countering the notion that investors should avoid the world's second-biggest economy. Though many on Wall Street have been bearish on China since 2023, its stock market is suddenly looking good relative to flagging US peers. Just a year ago, investors fled China in droves as they lost faith in its post-pandemic economy, and the exodus quickly back an ongoing problem for Beijing. Amid fear that China would buckle from deflation, unemployment, or its high debt environment, foreign direct investment last year hit its lowest level since 1992 . The CSI 300 Index, a benchmark of mainland shares, dropped over 45% from a 2021 peak to the end of last year. But now, while US stock leaders have suffered big declines since mid-February, Chinese large-caps have achieved their best annual start since 2002 . While the S&P 500 is down almost 10% from its February all-time high, the CSI 300 has topped a mid-December high and is up about 5% year-to-date. The moves are causing analysts to start paying attention. Citi recently upgraded China stocks to "Overweight," while dropping its view of US stocks to "Neutral." Meanwhile, Bank of America has said that the country will outperform this year , predicting that the previously "unloved" tech stocks will gain ground on sagging US peers . Pro-tech turnaround Before this year, many were skeptical about China's tech environment, which was weighed down by disapproval from Beijing officials. Since 2020, many of the nation's leading tech names have been caught in a regulatory "crackdown ," making investors hesitant to put money to work. But the government's changing approach toward the industry has been on full display in the past month, starting with President Xi Jinping's supportive remarks at a top tech symposium in February. Pro-business undertones continued in this week's "two sessions," a set of concurrent policy meetings that outline the country's economic goals. Ben Harburg, founder of Core Values Alpha, cited Beijing's recent embrace of its tech sector as one of several catalysts behind his firm's upside thesis. Eighteen months ago, his company created the CoreValues Alpha Greater China Growth ETF on the idea that investors have become too pessimistic about China's economy and its tech sector. Story Continues "[Beijing] very clearly said: 'Our national growth will be driven by technology,'" Harburg told Business Insider. "So it is unequivocal now they will lean in on technology, they will be supportive of technology, will do everything in their power to stimulate, subsidize, de-regulate — whatever is necessary to help technology kind of win." That's an alluring notion for stocks beaten down by an anti-tech narrative in recent years. As of late February, Chinese equities were trading at around a 50% discount compared to the US market. But the perceptions of China's negative view of the space might have been exagerrated, Harburg noted. "I don't think the Chinese government was ever an anti-tech as we were led to believe," he said, adding: "The world perceives it very differently, because [regulation] happens without any warning, and it and it kind of like just shocks people and throws them off." The crackdown narrative has given Chinese equities room to run higher this year, as it's helped lower valuations which are now moving upward. But it also helped catch US investors by surprise. Starting with China's DeepSeek tool , a flurry of competitive Chinese AI tools have debuted this year, upending confidence in America's leadership in the space and sparking a reevaluation of Beijing's market, Harburg said. As the AI trade has waned in the US this year, China's AI-linked stocks have soared on the back of the latest announcements. "Clearly, China is much further along than we were told," Harburg said. An economic turnaround? There are still challenges though, and, so far, Beijing's focus on tech is only a sentiment shift, said Tianlei Huang, a researcher for the Peterson Institute for International Economics. While positive signals were given, this remains a symbolic gesture without new policies. China's private sector—including tech— continues to face the same challenges that have pushed investors away since COVID, while confidence among entrepreneurs and consumers is at post-pandemic lows "The reaction in the stock market to this [tech] symposium is, I think, actually a very sad thing," he said. "Nothing in substance has really changed in terms of policy, regulations, right? It's just an attitude change." Many of the broader issues that have plagued China's economy are still in play. That includes a highly indebted real-estate sector and downbeat consumers, creating a deflationary environment from which investors have fled since 2023. But Beijing might finally be waking up to this as well. Over the past year, many of its stimulus measures have fallen short as they failed to target domestic consumers , which analysts agree are the linchpin to growth. Yet, during the two sessions, there was a new-found emphasis on domestic demand and private consumption. By Friday, stocks rose as the government urged financial lenders to ease loan terms for consumer borrowers. The shift toward domestic growth comes as China realizes it cannot reach this year's 5% GDP target by depending on trade, Huang said. This was the case last year, as net exports accounted for 30% of GDP. It's not a sustainable number, and it's largely driven by product stockpiling from buyers worried about Washington's trade war. It remains to be seen whether the 5% target is realistic, Huang said, though the sentiment shift is significant and should shape future policy. But Harburg sees things in a much brighter light. Aside from the positive mood in tech, he noted that investor fears about China haven not been realized. There's been no major real-estate crash and improvements are beginning to show in first-tier cities. "It doesn't happen for two years, three years, four years. And so the reality is, I think people are finally kind of fatigued with all of these stories that they were told," he said.

Reuters Lip-Bu Tan in an undated photo. Courtesy Intel Intel on Wednesday announced tech industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as its new chief executive, boosting shares of the US computer chipmaker struggling to catch up in the AI race. Tan told the Intel team his focus would be on engineering, saying it "won't be easy" to overcome challenges faced by the company. Tan, who was born in Malaysia, will start as Intel chief on March 18, according to the company. Shares were up more than 10 percent in after market trade. Intel is one of Silicon Valley's most iconic companies, but its fortunes have been eclipsed by Asian powerhouses TSMC and Samsung, which dominate the made-to-order semiconductor business. Live Events The company was also caught by surprise with the emergence of Nvidia, a graphics chip maker, as the world's preeminent AI chip provider. Nvidia's strength is in chips for powering AI, which are coveted by tech companies competing in that technology. Intel's niche has been in chips used in traditional computing processes being eclipsed by the AI rage. Tan's predecessor, Pat Gelsinger, was forced out as Intel chief in December after the board lost confidence in his plans to turn the company around. Gelsinger's abrupt departure came just months after the company vowed to cut more than 15,000 jobs in a draconian cost reduction plan and paused or delayed construction on several chipmaking facilities. "I believe with every fiber of my being that we have what it takes to win," Tan said in a message to his team, vowing that Intel will be an engineering-focused company. "In areas where we are behind the competition, we need to take calculated risks to disrupt and leapfrog." While chief of Cadence Design Systems from 2009 to 2021, Tan transformed the company and more than doubled its revenue, according to the Intel board. Former US president Joe Biden's administration last year finalized a $7.9 billion award to Intel as part of an effort to bring semiconductor production to US shores. But Intel in February extended the timeline for completing two new fabrication plants in Ohio, saying it is taking a prudent approach to the $28 billion project. "We will continue construction at a slower pace, while maintaining the flexibility to accelerate work and the start of operations if customer demand warrants," Intel Foundry Manufacturing general manager Naga Chandrasekaran told Intel employees at the time. For the full year 2024, Intel recorded a net loss of $18.8 billion as the US chip giant continues to struggle to stake its place in the artificial intelligence revolution. In Europe, Intel late last year said it was delaying its plans to build two mega chip-making factories in Germany and Poland as the company faces lower demand than anticipated. Intel also said at the time that it would pull back on its projects in Malaysia. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

Homepage opinion Comment & Analysis Elaine Loughlin: Texas visit a dry run for Taoiseach's meeting with Donald Trump Mr Trump is a transactional politician who looks for business opportunities everywhere, and a hint on what message Mr Martin might be wise to take into the Oval office came from Texas governor Greg Abbott Speaking before making his way to Washington for his much-anticipated tête-à-tête with Mr Trump, Micheál Martin (pictured) stressed Ireland’s need to invest in LNG, which the Government has confirmed is now firmly on the table. Wed, 12 Mar, 2025 - 00:31 Elaine Loughlin       “My decision to be here in Texas this week is an intentional one,” Micheál Martin told the gathered crowd in Austin. The Taoiseach explained that Austin, with its substantial tech sector and creative industry, represents the opportunities to deepen the economic relationship between Ireland and the US. But crucially, the Texas visit provided Mr Martin with the nearest thing to a dry run with Donald Trump he was going to get ahead of the actual meeting today. It was a balmy 24C when Mr Martin arrived at the governor’s mansion, a colonial style property straight out of Hollywood film, The Patriot . Crystal glasses of cold ice water were produced as the Taoiseach and his traveling party were left waiting in a reception room for Republican governor Greg Abbott, a man who during the meeting was keen to stress that he had been on the phone to Donald Trump, with whom is he very close, the night before. Texas is a truly red state and Mr Abbott, the longest-serving incumbent governor in the US, who also acted as Texas attorney general between 2002 to 2015, is a true MAGA Republican. Since entering the governor's office a decade ago, he has promoted an increasingly conservative agenda, including measures against abortion such as the Texas Heartbeat Act, lenient gun laws, and of course a tough stance on immigration. What's your view on this issue? You can tell us here During the pandemic Mr Abbott was vehemently against implementing face mask and vaccine mandates and went as far as blocking local governments, businesses, and other organisations from implementing their own. With many shunning vaccines, the west of the state is currently battling a measles outbreak , which has so far killed two. Last week, Mr Abbott accompanied vice president JD Vance and other Trump administration officials to Eagle Pass, Texas, along the US-Mexico border. It came after a visit to the Oval Office last month, during which the governor offered up a number of state facilities to help Mr Trump secure the border. "Texas has completed more than 50 miles of border wall," Mr Abbott said afterwards. We're going to be adding another 20 miles of border wall here in the coming days. It's under construction right now, and we've acquired more than 100 miles of easement. I let the president know that all of that is available for the USA. When Mr Abbott arrived into the room to a waiting Taoiseach on Monday, it was all smiles and pleasantries, his wife Cecilia keen to explain her Irish roots. But within moments, the Irish media pack were ushered out of the room and back onto the shaded white veranda. It is understood the meeting, which lasted around 40 minutes, covered Mr Martin's visit to Dell earlier that morning and Ireland's pro-enterprise model as well as infrastructure investment in the years ahead. Liquified national gas Mr Trump is a transactional politician who looks for business opportunities everywhere, and a hint on what message Mr Martin might be wise to take into the Oval office came from the governor. A readout hinted to what could be bartered in a potential tariff trade-off: "The governor touted Texas as the leading state for liquified national gas (LNG) exports and noted the importance of continued collaboration between Texas and Ireland in the energy industry." Increasing imports of LNG from the US has already been raised as a potential way to avoid a threatened 25% tariff on EU goods. Speaking before making his way to Washington for his much-anticipated tête-à-tête with Mr Trump, Mr Martin stressed Ireland’s need to invest in LNG, which the Government has confirmed is now firmly on the table. "It has been very clear to us by officials how serious the vulnerability is for Ireland. If anything was to happen to gas connectors, in terms of the Irish economy we would not survive a week without some back-up, with some energy security. It's very stark, actually. “So it's a fundamental responsibility, nothing to do with timing or just visit or anything like that. We have to have energy security. " While the Taoiseach was remaining brief in his description of discussions with the governor, it is understood Mr Abbott did advise him that Trump is a very personable man, easy to get along with. But that advice of course came from someone who very much speaks Mr Trump's language. Mr Martin can only hope today’s Oval Office encounter goes as well as his discussions with Mr Abbott, who has now been invited to visit Ireland.

By Canadian Press Carney’s win kills Liberals’ much-delayed plan to change capital gains tax Mar 11, 2025 | 9:36 AM Share on Facebook Share on Bluesky Share on X Copy Link OTTAWA — Mark Carney’s victory in the Liberal leadership race puts the final nail in the coffin of Ottawa’s controversial plan to hike the inclusion rate on capital gains. When they tabled their budget last spring, the federal Liberals presented the plan to change capital gains as a way to get wealthy Canadians and corporations to pay more — but the plan has faced a series of delays ever since. Tax expert Jamie Golombek of CIBC says the capital gains changes are still causing “confusion” during this tax season, even though the higher inclusion rate won’t be in play. Carney confirmed in his victory speech on Sunday that he would kill the planned capital gains hike.

He returned as a Stanford graduate student and a budding entrepreneur, to a country trying to jumpstart its tech industry. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Syria is still struggling three months after its revolution. There are glimmers of hope. At one hotel, hundreds of people recently gathered to talk about jump-starting the country's tech industry, which was virtually nonexistent during Syria's civil war. One young man fled that war as a teenager. He returned as a Stanford grad student and a budding entrepreneur. NPR's Greg Myre has the story from the capital, Damascus. And a warning - this piece does include descriptions of torture and abuse. GREG MYRE, BYLINE: Some 700 people - most from Syria and some from the U.S. - filled a ballroom at the Sheraton Hotel in Damascus for the tech conference dubbed Silicon Valley in Syria. ABDULWAHAB OMIRA: Everyone was here, and everyone is excited. Everyone, like - you know, this excitement of like, hey, we want to build. We want to do something for our country. We're so happy. MYRE: Abdulwahab Omira is a young Syrian American who took a break from his master's program at Stanford to attend. Like everyone at the conference, he acknowledged the staggering challenges after 14 years of civil war. OMIRA: There's no infrastructure. There is no electricity. There is no water. There's no internet. Showering is an event. MYRE: Omira says his own experience taught him resilience, and he believes many Syrians have learned the same lesson. As a teenager in Damascus, he studied the high cancer rates in an area where the Syrian government disposed of nuclear waste. He proposed a new method and was awarded a patent at age 14 and was supposed to be honored at the presidential palace. But before that happened, he was stopped one day by the security forces. They found documents related to the nuclear program, and Omira was tossed in prison. The experience was harrowing. OMIRA: They start bringing people in, killing them under torture, showing me how they killed them. And each room has a different theme of killing - so many horrible stuff. Like, room No. 3, for example, they killed people with, like, a chainsaw. MYRE: Omira was not physically harmed, but he was warned that if he was arrested again... OMIRA: You will choose one of those rooms to die in. MYRE: Omira was released after two months, and his family decided it was time to leave Syria. They went from a prosperous life in Damascus to a tent in a refugee camp in neighboring Turkey. Eventually, they made it to the U.S., landing in Chicago. But Omira didn't speak English or have a valid high school diploma. He kept studying until he got a perfect score on the college entrance exam and admission to Stanford University. He graduated with a computer science degree last year. He's now in the masters program, working on artificial intelligence. He also runs a tech startup designed to help farmers in Syria. And he's meeting with tech students throughout the country. OMIRA: We went to seven universities across Syria where we give workshops for the students. MYRE: Still, the obstacles in Syria can seem endless. U.S. sanctions remain. They were imposed against Syria's dictator, Bashar al-Assad, and though he was ousted three months ago, the sanctions have not been lifted. This was a recurring theme at the tech conference. Organizer Rama Chakaki is a Syrian American and a tech investor from California. RAMA CHAKAKI: Absolutely. So the sanctions now are quite prohibitive. I mean, the banking system is disconnected from the rest of the world. And so folks like me can never invest in Syria until these sanctions are lifted. MYRE: For now, the goal is to connect Syria's tech community, which was so isolated during the war. CHAKAKI: One thing about Syrians is we're very socially interconnected. All of us having been in the diaspora, feeling very displaced, couldn't wait for that chance to get together. So my 12,000 connections on LinkedIn worked really well for me. MYRE: When Abdulwahab Omira returned to Syria, he visited his old family home. OMIRA: I went to my room. I was digging out my memories, and then I found my first CS book - computer science book - that I got in seventh grade. They were explaining what the internet is, how to use the keyboard, how to turn off the PC. MYRE: Omira has come a long way since then. He summed up his journey from refugee to Stanford student to tech entrepreneur this way. OMIRA: The U.S. was definitely the land of opportunity because if you put, like, 100%, you get 100%. In Turkey, if you put 100%, you get probably, like, get 10%. Here if you put 100%, you get in prison. MYRE: He's hoping to write a new formula for a new Syria. Greg Myre, NPR News, Damascus.

Title: Bay Area tech sector hiring boom fades

By George Avalos | gavalos@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: March 10, 2025 at 10:49 AM PDT | UPDATED: March 10, 2025 at 11:08 AM PDT The Bay Area tech sector’s gains from the pandemic have nosedived into a bust. “In the last half of 2020, and throughout 2021 and the first part of 2022, the major Bay Area technology firms went on wild hiring sprees that were never sustainable,” said Michael Bernick, an employment attorney and a former director of the state Employment Development Department. In that time, tech companies have fundamentally shifted their hiring strategies, said Russell Hancock, president of Joint Venture Silicon Valley, a San Jose think tank. “Silicon Valley has entered a state of uncertainty and flux,” he said. “It’s driven employers to focus on efficiency and sustainable profits.” The contrast between the boom and the subsequent bust in the Bay Area is stark, according to seasonally adjusted industry totals that Beacon Economics culled from the Employment Development Department. “Tech employment has been on a roller coaster since the pandemic started in 2020,” said Scott Anderson, BMO Capital Markets’ chief U.S. economist and managing director. The plunge has affected the jobs of tens of thousands of workers, including employees at a slew of industry icons. In 2020, Bay Area tech companies added workers when the world abruptly shifted to remote work and distance learning. Tech extended the gains into 2021 and 2022. The tech sector scrambled to hire people quickly enough to meet the fevered demand for working from home. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, the Bay Area added 74,700 tech jobs, Beacon’s compilation shows. But in 2023 and 2024, employers slashed a net total of 80,200 tech jobs in the region. “The tech employment resurgence was short-lived,” Anderson said. “Tech industry overhiring earlier in the pandemic likely aggravated the tech job losses.” Despite shedding jobs, tech companies are seeking to fine-tune hiring as they scout for fertile new fields in artificial intelligence, said Tim Bajarin, principal analyst with Creative Strategies in Campbell. “Demand for tech workers is still strong, but more focused and targeted toward AI, high-speed computing and integration of AI into business processes,” Bajarin said. For now, however, the tech industry must cope with more immediate challenges, such as the region’s brutal housing problems and uncertain federal policies. “Deportations, tariffs and continuing lack of enough new housing will present challenges,” said Steven Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto. “We must come together to overcome and preserve our unique advantages as an innovative economy.” The first warning signs for tech surfaced in late 2022, when Facebook app owner Meta Platforms encountered a rare event in its corporate history: a decline in revenue. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s top boss, pursued ways to streamline the social media network’s operations. Layoffs quickly became a prime solution. In November 2022, Meta announced it would eliminate 11,000 jobs worldwide, including 2,565 jobs in the Bay Area, state notices showed. Before long, it became clear that the tech industry’s woes weren’t confined to Facebook. Amazon, Cisco, Salesforce and Tesla followed suit, turning a trickle of cuts into a stream and then a flood of layoffs. Still, it took one more significant event to make it clear that the tech’s bust wouldn’t immediately yield to yet another boom. In January 2023, Google chopped 1,600 Bay Area jobs. Suddenly, efficiency and streamlining became industry watchwords as AI beckoned from the horizon. “We think the last two years are the result of more than the economic cycle,” said Jeff Bellisario, executive director of the Bay Area Council Economic Institute. “The region and the state need to do more to attract and retain all types of employers.” By the end of 2024, the tech industry in the Bay Area had shriveled to 880,200 jobs, far below the peak level of 960,400 that it had reached by the end of 2022. The Bay Area tech sector is even smaller than it was in 2019, when it accounted for 885,700 jobs. The tech industry’s job losses are particularly pronounced in the South Bay and the San Francisco-San Mateo metro area, sometimes touted as a trendy spot for fledgling tech firms. The tech downturn has hammered the San Francisco metro area the hardest, with a loss of 39,600 tech jobs in 2023 and 2024, or an 11% plunge in that urban center’s tech jobs. The South Bay hasn’t fared much better. Over the same two years, the area lost 33,300 tech jobs for a decline of 8.1%. The tech industry’s fading fortunes have also jolted the East Bay, but to a much lesser extent. The East Bay lost 6,500 tech jobs over the last two years, a 3.9% decline. While the Bay Area remains a primary hub for the worldwide tech industry despite recent job losses, the sector’s faltering job market could erode some of the region’s dominance. “It’s hard to say anything for certain, but we may be looking at a tectonic shift, where Silicon Valley becomes one node in a more dispersed innovation ecosystem,” Hancock said. One thing seems certain: The once high-flying tech industry has come back to Earth. “The past two years, economic reality has set in,” Bernick said.

"When women are at the forefront of decision-making in organisations, whether as creators, innovators, or leaders, business results follow," Dasgupta stated. However, she pointed out the stark reality of India's workforce participation rate for women, which remains at a mere 40.3%. "The challenge isn’t a lack of talent—it’s the systemic barriers that limit access and opportunities." Dasgupta's comments come at a time when the tech industry is increasingly recognizing the importance of diversity and inclusion. She stressed the need for concrete actions beyond mere acknowledgment. "As an industry, tech leaders need to continue to elevate and invest in women by creating leadership opportunities, mentorship, and support systems that enable them to thrive." HP India , under Dasgupta's leadership, is taking significant strides in this direction. "At HP India, one of our key strategies has been to focus on hiring, retaining, and investing in women," she revealed. This commitment has resulted in women now comprising one-third of their workforce, a substantial increase from "the low double digits not long ago." A key initiative driving this change is HP India's "Disha" program, which focuses on enhancing leadership skills for high-potential women, empowering them to advance in their careers. Dasgupta highlighted the tangible results of this investment, stating, "I’m especially proud that our Supplies product team, Growth, and Strategy teams are led by women – proof that when you invest in women, they rise." Beyond internal initiatives, Dasgupta believes in the power of advocacy. "It’s incumbent on us to actively advocate and champion female talent, encourage them to take risks and be vocal for opportunities," she asserted. She emphasized that the future of technology is inextricably linked to the inclusion of women's diverse perspectives and leadership. "The future of technology needs women’s ideas, perspectives, and leadership, and it’s on all of us to make that future a reality.” Dasgupta's message resonates with a growing understanding that empowering women in tech is not just a matter of social justice, but a strategic imperative for innovation and economic growth.

News | Science Houston, we have a solution: Why Britain can win big by betting on the new space race Britain’s space industry is quietly booming — now it’s time to launch it to new heights The astronauts stranded in space have said they do not feel let down by Boeing (Nasa/PA) PA Media Will Rogers-Coltman 7 March 2025 COMMENTS Listen here on your chosen podcast platform. Britain and space exploration hardly sound like natural bedfellows. In fact, many may be surprised to hear that Britain has a space programme at all: the UK Space Agency, who, led by CEO Dr Paul Bate, have ambitions of making the country one of the world’s leading space economies. Despite the public’s perception, Will Whitehorn, the former president of Virgin Galactic , is truly optimistic about this mission. “The UK space tech industry makes up 7 percent of the global market,” Whitehorn says, “but far more importantly, we have some of the greatest minds in the industry and a fantastic technological heritage. You would be hard-pressed to find a space mission that hasn’t got a bit of tech invented by a British company.” Take the Artemis mission for example, where Thales Alenia Space UK is making the refuelling module for the Lunar Gateway–a space station that will orbit the moon. Since Donald Trump’s re-election in November, space exploration has been thrust back to the top of the global agenda, with the president announcing at his inauguration that planting flags on the planet Mars was part of their “manifest destiny”. President Donald Trump speaks at an indoor Presidential Inauguration parade event in Washington (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) AP Investment in the UK’s space sector–an industry that employs 60,000 people–is a practical imperative for the growth of the country’s economy, Whitehorn says. A staggering 16 percent of the UK’s GDP is dependent on space technology , the UK Space Agency say. Of course that doesn’t mean we’re spending that much money on space travel. Rather, it shows just how reliant we are on satellites for crucial technologies such as weather monitoring, mobile connectivity, TV broadcasting, and even WIFI. Clearly space technology is more than just exploration: it’s the backbone of our global technological revolution. The UK in space The UK’s first involvement in the space race came in 1952. By 1962, the UK had launched it’s first satellite - the Ariel 1. The first British astronaut, Helen Sharman, went into space in 1991 when she visited the Mir Space Station. The UK Space Agency was founded in 2010. Britain still remains part of the European Space Agency (ESA), with Brexit not impacting its position. It drives advancements in AI infrastructure, with data centres in space to power artificial intelligence expected within ten years; climate solutions, including plans for off-planet solar panels that bypass cloud interference; and defence systems, where satellites are crucial for GPS and surveillance. The UK’s role in these industries demands that we grow our space technology sector, Doug Liddle, chairman of UKSpace, says. “With the groundbreaking success of private companies like SpaceX , we’re on the brink of a full-scale space economy,” says Liddle. Read More Elon Musk throws SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft project into doubt Space freed up by car clubs could nearly cover Hyde Park, analysis finds London Tech Week 2025: All you need to know about week-long event Sponsored Past AXA Startup Angel winners share their tips “If the UK wants a big slice of the pie, the government needs to set a precedent and boost investment into the many exciting British space technology companies.” One example is Space Forge, a Cardiff based aerospace startup specialising in in-space manufacturing, which ingeniously utilises space’s unique conditions–lack of gravity, vacuum, and extreme temperatures–to build materials that are incredibly difficult to make on earth. After nine months in power, the government’s plans for public investment into Britain’s space industry are still vague. In the meantime, it’s up to events like the Space-Comm Expo at the Excel Centre (11-12 March) to stir public interest and boost private investment. Space-Comm Expo Hayley Bray Photography With America moving towards isolationist policies, Whitehorn thinks conferences like Space-Comm exemplify the UK’s unique position as a bridge between Europe and the US’ space missions: “Where else will you find a conference where the head of ESA and senior members of NASA attend?” Liddle agrees, saying, “By having one foot in the European Space Agency–as its fourth biggest contributing nation–and the other in the US–with a close defence budget relationship that shares data and resources with our friends across the pond–the UK is in a strong position and the future looks bright.” “There’s an industrial revolution happening in space,” Whitehorn adds, “and with increased investment, Britain can be a key player.” The Space-Comm Expo is free to attend.

Building inclusive tech teams: Why diversity matters in software delivery By Hasina Sayed , issued by BET Software 10 Mar 2025 10 Mar 2025 Whatsapp Print PDF X Linked-in Facebook More sharing options Technology drives the future, but true innovation happens when diverse minds come together. For years, the tech industry has faced a gap in representation, missing out on the unique insights and problem-solving abilities that diversity brings. As we acknowledge International Women’s Day on 8 March, we recognise the vital role of inclusive teams in shaping smarter, more impactful software solutions. When we open doors to different perspectives, we don’t just build better technology – we build a stronger, more connected world. Author: Hasina Sayed, software delivery lead for BET Software According to the World Economic Forum, at the current rate of progress, it will take until 2158 to achieve full gender parity. This staggering statistic highlights the importance of accelerating change and driving diversity in every industry, especially in tech. As a woman who has spent over a decade in the tech gambling industry, I’ve seen how much impact diverse teams can have – not only on fostering innovation but on creating better software solutions that serve a wide range of users. In an industry that thrives on creativity and constant evolution, gender diversity is not just beneficial, it’s essential. From my personal experience, the difference diversity makes is evident in how we approach problem solving and decision making. As women, we often bring unique perspectives to the table, shaped by our distinct life experiences. These different viewpoints challenge the status quo and spark new ideas. Throughout my career, I’ve noticed that my colleagues and I often think about problems from angles that may not have been considered before, leading to solutions that are more inclusive and innovative. In the fast-paced world of tech, this creative thinking is key to staying ahead of the curve and building software that addresses a wide variety of needs. Gender diversity also plays a vital role in ensuring the software we create is truly reflective of the people who use it. In the gambling tech industry, for example, our user base is diverse, and understanding both male and female perspectives is essential to building products that resonate with everyone. As a woman in this field, I’ve seen how including more female voices in development teams leads to a deeper understanding of user needs. This diversity enables teams to design products that are not only functional but also accessible, engaging, and more likely to meet the needs of a broader audience. Moreover, inclusive teams foster a culture of collaboration and respect, where all voices are valued. Over the years, I’ve found that the best decisions often come when different perspectives are considered. When women feel empowered to share their ideas and challenge assumptions, it creates an environment where innovation can flourish. In turn, this results in higher-quality software, as diverse teams work together to find solutions that are well-rounded and thoughtful. Lastly, companies that prioritise gender equality and inclusivity in tech are more likely to attract top talent. A diverse and inclusive environment is not only more welcoming but also offers better opportunities for growth and career advancement. As more women enter the tech industry, it’s crucial that we continue to build environments where everyone, regardless of gender, feels respected and empowered to contribute their best ideas. In conclusion, achieving gender parity in tech will take time, but by building inclusive teams and embracing diversity, we can accelerate progress. Diversity isn’t just a buzzword – it’s a driving force behind innovation and better software delivery. As a woman in tech, I’ve seen first-hand that when we foster diverse teams, we not only create better products but also pave the way for a more inclusive and equitable industry.

Title: Stocks Nosedive to the Worst Level of 2025 as Trump Waffles on Tariffs
Date: 20250306T213000Z

Article Content:
By Gabe Whisnant and Sonam Sheth Share Newsweek is a Trust Project member ​Another sharp sell-off on Wall Street sent the Nasdaq into correction territory—meaning it was 10 percent below its recent peak—on Thursday, while the S&P 500 had its worst trading day of the year. The Context It was the fourth day in a row that stocks plunged amid the market turmoil related to President Donald Trump 's whiplash on the U.S.'s tariffs on its biggest trading partners, Canada and Mexico. When asked whether his delays on tariffs reflected the slump for the stock market, Trump said Thursday, "I'm not even looking at the market." He earlier in the Oval Office blamed the falling prices on "globalist countries and companies that won't be doing as well because we're taking back things that have been taken from us many years ago." What To Know The S&P 500 dropped 1.8 percent, while the Nasdaq plunged 2.6 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 1 percent. The S&P 500's second-worst trading day of the year occurred just three days ago, with a decline of 1.76 percent, as Trump's trade war loomed. ... Trump granted another temporary reprieve to Mexico and Canada on Thursday, saying he would delay imposing tariffs on products from the two countries that are covered under the USMCA trade agreement. But the market remained volatile as concerns grew that an escalating global trade war could slow economic growth and worsen inflation. The tech sector was hit particularly hard as AI companies saw significant losses that dragged the market as a whole down. Trump made tariffs a key pillar of his economic platform during the 2024 election and made good on his threat to impose steep tariffs on Mexico and Canada on Tuesday. He also raised an initial 10 percent tariff on China that went into effect in February. Canada and China responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own, while Mexico said it would issue its response by Sunday. The market immediately reacted to the tariffs; the Dow dropped 1.55 percent, or 670 points, adding to a 650-point plummet on Monday. The Nasdaq closed 0.35 percent down and at its lowest was down 2 percent, briefly entering correction territory before recovering. Trump, for his part, has previously acknowledged that Americans could feel "some pain" associated with tariffs but insisted it would "all be worth the price that must be paid." Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau didn't mince words when responding on Tuesday to the tariffs. "A fight with Canada will have no winners," he said, adding that the trade was "very dumb." Trump started backtracking on tariffs on Wednesday, saying there would be a carveout for U.S. automakers who could be hit hardest by a trade war. On Thursday, the president announced that Mexican goods that fall under the USMCA would not be subject to tariffs until next month, adding that he made the accommodation "out of respect for [Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum]." "Our relationship has been a very good one, and we are working hard, together, on the Border, both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and, likewise, stopping Fentanyl," Trump added. Later in the day, Trump signed an executive order saying that Canadian goods covered by USMCA would also be granted a reprieve for another month and added a carveout for Canadian potash. What People Are Saying Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management, told the Associated Press: "These exemptions don't do much to resolve the general air of uncertainty. Businesses will still be cautious in the current environment until a lot more of the tariff picture is clear." Strategists at BNP Paribas told the AP: "Much will depend on whether these new tariffs prove temporary or are toned down. But even if they are ultimately removed, we anticipate lasting damage to global economic activity." What Happens Next Wall Street will be looking at the U.S. Labor Department's jobs report, set for release on Friday, which will reveal how many workers U.S. employers hired last month. A strong job market, coupled with robust consumer spending, has played a critical role in preventing a recession so far. Economists anticipate an acceleration in hiring for February, signaling continued resilience in the labor market. Reporting by the Associated Press contributed to this article.

An ASML representative said that the repair centre mentioned in the plan is “an upgrade to our existing repair centre in China. It is not an addition, it replaces the older repair centre.” It has been previously reported that the Dutch government could limit ASML’s ability to repair and maintain its semiconductor equipment on the mainland.

Xi Jinping wants to grow China's economy (Image: Getty) Donald Trump's new tariffs on China could make it harder for Beijing to attract investment into its high tech sector, according to an expert. The White House slapped a new 10% tariff on Chinese imports on Tuesday, increasing fears of a major trade war between the two countries. This follows the 10% levy imposed in early February, taking the total US tariffs to 20% since Trump re-entered the White House. The move comes at a difficult time for Beijing, with the government grappling with a number of economic woes. Low consumption, a property crisis and youth unemployment have dampened confidence in the overall economy despite strong exports over the past two years, giving China an almost trillion-dollar trade surplus.

The government is also looking to attract investment into its high tech industries, in particular artificial intelligence (AI) and green energy. Both sectors are seen as vital to government plans to grow and diversify the economy. The success of DeepSeek sparked an AI-driven stock rally, with analysts noting renewed interest in China among foreign investors.

"The chaos that tariffs leave in their wake is kryptonite for investment," Harry Murphy Cruise said. "Tariffs are set to deliver a one-two punch to China's economy, landing blows to both exports and investment." He noted the a prolonged period of tariffs could cut Chinese exports to the US by between one quarter and a third. China reacted with fury to the Trump's new levies, placing retaliatory tariffs of between 10%-15% on a number of US agricultural goods. The levies will come into effect rom March 10 and will affect chicken, beef, pork and soybeans. Lin Jian, a foreign ministry spokesperson vowed that "China will fight to the bitter end of any trade war".

President Donald Trump has threatened to hit semiconductor imports with a 25% tariff Credit: FrentaN / Shutterstock The impact of tariffs by the Trump Administration on semiconductors from Taiwan is so far not cause for alarm, according to one analyst. President Donald Trump has threatened to hit semiconductor imports with a 25% tariff in an effort to incentivize chipmakers to manufacture chips in the United States instead of importing them. This ignores the reality that there aren’t enough fabrication plants in the US to make all these chips begin with, and building them will not be accomplished overnight. Potential impacts to businesses are likely to be minimal, according to Scott Almassy, US semiconductor lead for PwC. “In their purest sense, for a majority of the higher end [companies] in the semiconductor industry, it’s not as big a deal. It’s more just a nuisance that needs to be assessed, managed and obviously monitored,” Almassy said. “But I don’t think it’s upsetting the fundamental medium- or long-range plans of most companies.” Almassy’s argument is that the cost will not be fully passed on to the customer and instead will be absorbed by the OEM that buys the chips. Chipmakers like TSMC and GlobalFoundries don’t sell directly to end users but rather to OEMs like HPE and Supermicro, and they can absorb some of the cost. “I think it will vary by industry,” Almassy said. “Obviously the middle ground would be splitting it 50% with the supplier, 50% to the consumer. I think it’s going to be a calculus that’s going to have to be done by each individual company with where they feel like they are in the value chain, and what kind of pricing power they have.” Almassy says tariffs will definitely be felt by consumers more than IT organizations because there are “fewer levers consumers can pull” and fewer actions that consumers can take than enterprises, which are constantly on edge about what they need to do to maintain and grow their business, and what’s around the corner. The idea behind tariffs is to increase domestic manufacturing, but Almassy notes the United Stated doesn’t have the manufacturing capacity or capability that Taiwan does. TSMC, Samsung, and GlobalFoundries have some fabs here, but they are not building the most leading edge technologies. “Those are all in Taiwan at the moment. Those fabs take years to ramp up right. And then you need the workforce to be able to turn them into profitable factories. That doesn’t happen overnight either,” he said. Almassy said it’s not possible to predict when the tariffs will hit because they haven’t been implemented yet. “The magnitude of it remains to be seen, based on the duration and the overall macro connection and how things play out more broadly,” he said. Still, others say tariffs would harm the industry. “The tech industry is a global industry, and as we saw during Trump’s first term, if you place restrictions on any part of the value chain, you impact the entire value chain in one way or another. Between Trump’s threats and [China president Xi Jinping’s] threats [referring to the restriction of rare earth materials], the tech industry could be in for a very rough ride, not to mention the US and global economies,” said Jim McGregor, principal analyst with Tirias Research, in a recent Network World article SUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER From our editors straight to your inbox Get started by entering your email address below.

Stock heatmap by FinViz.com Tue, 04 Mar 2025 14:46:11 GMT Sector Overview The stock market today showcases a challenging scene for technology stocks, with significant declines in the semiconductor and key tech companies. The sector is clearly underperforming, as major names such as Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Nvidia ( NVDA ) see drops of 1.92% and 1.84% respectively. On the other hand, consumer defensive stocks display a measure of resilience. Companies like Procter & Gamble ( PG ) are up by 1.06% , reflecting investor interest in traditionally stable industries amid market volatility. Market Mood and Trends The overall mood in the market today is tentative, witnessing varying investor confidence across sectors. The downturn in technology stocks suggests growing concerns possibly linked to geopolitical tensions or industry-specific challenges. Meanwhile, the modest performances in consumer defensive sectors hint at a cautious yet strategic shift by investors towards more reliable havens. Moreover, declines in the consumer cyclical sector, with Amazon ( AMZN ) and Tesla ( TSLA ) down 2.88% and 4.55% respectively, point to broader worries affecting discretionary spending and economic outlook. Strategic Recommendations With today's tech sector turbulence, investors might consider a hedging strategy by diversifying into consumer defensive stocks that show relative strength. Additionally, keeping an eye on upcoming earnings reports and economic updates will be crucial in navigating future market shifts. Tech-savvy investors should weigh potential opportunities for buying at a discount amidst tech sector declines, provided they carry out a comprehensive risk assessment. As always, staying attuned to real-time updates and having a balanced portfolio could offer a viable path through this uncertain market landscape.

Title: Empowering Women Tech Entrepreneurs in Georgia Unleashes Innovation

Article Content:
Women in Georgia’s tech sector must navigate the same obstacles as their male counterparts in launching a startup—but on top of that, they also have to contend with another set of mutually reinforcing barriers rooted in people’s expectations of men’s and women’s roles, including skepticism about their capabilities, lack of female role models, fewer networking opportunities, and difficulties in securing investments and support for their ventures. This has real costs for Georgia’s economy. Start-ups create jobs and new products and services, strengthen local and regional value chains, and drive innovation. Competing on an unequal playing field deprives the country of new enterprises that could boost economic growth and help reduce poverty. Empowering women in tech is essential to unlock Georgia’s full economic potential and remain competitive globally. Addressing this gender gap was central to the World Bank’s Georgia National Innovation Ecosystem (GENIE) Project , which, since 2016 to 2023, has played a critical role in boosting the country’s innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem through trainings, grants, technical assistance, and setting up infrastructure like incubators and regional hubs. Over half of GENIE beneficiaries have been women, many of whom have not only turned their innovative ideas into successful startups but have also become role models for other aspiring female entrepreneurs—helping lay the foundations for a more inclusive, competitive tech sector. Supporting Women-Led Start-Ups: Nato and Ana One of these GENIE success stories is Nato Toronjadze, the founder and CEO of Bizon, one of the leading online Georgian marketplaces for connecting buyers and sellers of heavy machinery and agricultural equipment.

David Paul Morris / Bloomberg via Getty Images Close Key Takeaways U.S. consumers are showing signs of preparing to cut back on spending as they brace to absorb price increases from President Donald Trump's tariff campaign. Surveys show people are growing more worried about inflation and unemployment and are planning to cut back on essentials and discretionary purchases if tariffs push inflation. Consumer spending is the backbone of U.S. economic growth and slowing spending could make a recession more likely. President Donald Trump's tariffs are already shifting how people spend their money, in an ominous sign for the future of the economy. Evidence is mounting that consumers are tightening their belts as they brace for tariffs to push up prices on all kinds of imports. In February, U.S. households cut back their spending on services while ramping up purchases of goods, which is a possible sign that people are rushing to buy things before tariffs hit, according to a report on spending and inflation from the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Friday. In a separate survey by the University of Michigan Friday, expectations of future inflation rose to their highest since 2022, and expectations for unemployment rose to their highest since the Great Recession, flashing a warning sign that households might be preparing to cut back on shopping. The latest data highlights the seismic impact that Trump's continually shifting tariff policies have had on the economy in recent weeks . Economists have become more concerned that consumers, facing price increases on many products, will cut back on spending, undercutting an important pillar of the economy's health: consumer spending is the main engine of economic growth, making up 68% of the Gross Domestic Product. Consumers Could Stop Buying... Households plan to cut back their spending significantly on both essentials and discretionary items if there is tariff-driven inflation, according to a survey this week by Morning Consult, a research firm. Among households with income of less than $50,000, 35% plan to cut back on groceries, and 19% making more than $100,000 said the same. More than 20% of all income groups in the survey said they would cut back on dining out and clothing. "U.S. consumers are increasingly inflation-weary, their finances are more fragile, and they face higher risks in the labor market," Deni Koenhemsi, head of economic analysis at Morning Consult, wrote in a commentary. "These dynamics place U.S. consumer spending on a different trajectory compared to the previous shock—the pandemic—or the last time President Trump introduced tariffs." Behind the trend are expectations that Trump's import taxes will push up the cost of living. Not only are merchants likely to pass on the cost of tariffs to consumers, but decreased competition from imports will allow U.S.-based companies to raise their own prices, multiple economists have predicted. ...And Are Worried About Their Jobs At the same time, fears of a slowdown in the job market are growing. While the unemployment rate has stayed near record lows in recent months, employers have cut back on hiring, and a tariff-driven slowdown of the economy could drag down job growth even further. Most economists predict the job market to stay on steady footing, at least in the short term, but consumers aren't so sure: two-thirds of people surveyed by Michigan this month anticipated unemployment to rise in the year ahead, the highest percentage since 2009. "This trend reveals a key vulnerability for consumers, given that strong labor markets and incomes have been the primary source of strength supporting consumer spending in recent years," Joanne Hsu, Surveys of Consumers director at the University of Michigan, wrote in a commentary. Those Concerns Are Bad For the Economy In recent years, consumer spending has kept the economy afloat despite powerful forces dragging it down. The economy has avoided a recession despite high inflation in 2022, and after that, high borrowing costs imposed by the Federal Reserve in an effort to push inflation down to pre-pandemic levels. But the tariffs could be the last straw for household finances already strained by steep cost-of-living increases. The U.S. economy is on track to shrink 2.8% in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's GDP Now tool. "So far, consumers are not coming to rescue economic growth as they have so many times in recent years," Tim Quinlan and Shannon Grein, economists at Wells Fargo Securities, wrote in a commentary.

(AP Photo/Achmad Ibrahim) (ASSOCIATED PRESS) JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — The usual festive mood of Eid al-Fitr holiday to mark the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan has been subdued in Indonesia this year as people grapple with soaring prices for food, clothing and essential goods. Consumer spending ahead of the biggest religious holiday for Muslims, which was celebrated on Sunday in Indonesia, has declined compared to the previous year, with a predicted slowdown in cash circulation due to fewer travelers. Each year in Indonesia, nearly three-quarters of the population of the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country travel for the annual homecoming known locally as “mudik” that is always welcomed with excitement. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement People pour out of major cities to return to villages to celebrate the holiday with prayers, feasts and family gatherings. Flights are overbooked and anxious relatives weighed down with boxes of gifts form long lines at bus and train stations for the journey But this year the Transportation Ministry said Eid travelers reached 146 million people, a 24% drop from last year’s 194 million travelers. The Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry projects that money circulation during Eid will reach 137.97 trillion rupiah ($8.33 billion), down from 157.3 trillion last year. The weakening purchasing power is also reflected in Bank Indonesia’s Consumer Confidence Index which dipped to 126.4 in February from 127.2 in January. Bhima Yudistira, executive director of the Center for Economic and Law Studies, or Celios, said those trends indicate the economy is under strain, driven by economic hardship, coupled with currency depreciation and mass layoffs in manufacturing. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “These have weakened both corporate earnings and workers’ incomes that suppress consumer spending,” Yudistira said, adding he “expects a less vibrant festive season.” He said the festive spirit has been stifled by harsh economic realities, as soaring prices and dwindling incomes force residents to prioritize survival over celebration. Traditionally household consumption is a key driver of Indonesia’s GDP. It contributed over 50% to the economy last year, helping push annual growth to 5.11%. However, consumer spending in 2025 is expected to be more subdued, Yudistira said. Despite the downturn, the government remains optimistic that the Ramadan and Eid momentum will support economic growth in the first quarter of 2025. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “Eid usually boosts the economy through increased spending,” Chief Economic Affairs Minister Airlangga Hartarto said ahead of the Islamic holiday. The government recently introduced incentives to stimulate economic activity, including airfare and toll road fee discounts, nationwide online shopping events, direct cash assistance for 16 million households, electricity bill reductions for low-consumption customers, and tax exemptions for labor-intensive sectors. “With these programs in place, the government hopes to sustain consumer spending and support economic stability,” Hartarto said. The situation has also affected Endang Trisilowati, a mother of four, who said her family had to scale down their festivities budget. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “Honestly, the economic hardship is affecting us,” Trisilowati said. She described how she used to cook different dishes every Eid and invite neighbors, but now she can only afford a simple meal for her family. “Many have resorted to just finding a way to eat on that festivity, but the spirit is low,” she said. Muslims in India grapple with discrimination In India, Muslims are marking the celebration of Eid with special prayers, family gatherings and festive meals. The holiday comes as the minority community faces vilification by hardline Hindu nationalists. Muslim groups are also protesting against a proposal by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to change laws governing Muslim land endowments. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The government says it wants to weed out corruption and mismanagement in hundreds of thousands of Muslim land endowments. But Muslim groups say the proposal pending approval in India’s parliament is discriminatory. Muslims, who comprise 14% of India’s 1.4 billion population, are the largest minority group in the Hindu-majority nation. Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party launched a nationwide initiative called “Saugat-e-Modi,” or “Modi’s gift,” during Ramadan that is expected to provide food and clothes to over 3 million underprivileged Muslims to celebrate Eid. In New Delhi, thousands assembled in the Jama Masjid, one of the country’s largest mosques, to offer Eid prayers. Families came together early Monday morning and many people shared hugs and wishes.

Inflation’s Up and Sentiment’s Down as Consumers Pad Their Savings By PYMNTS | March 28, 2025 | The push and pull of various pressures — inflation, tariffs and worries about the general state of affairs — has shown up in several economic reports released Friday (March 28).

Δ A connecting of the dots indicates that consumer spending was anemic, in real terms, as inflation continues to run hot. Sentiment’s at an ebb not seen in years, and households boosted their savings where they could, likely as a buffer against the uncertainties of what comes next. Data indicated that inflation accelerated at a pace not seen in more than a year. Consumer spending gained some ground on a month-over-month basis , but it must be noted that that increase comes off a lower base in January, which declined from December — and the latest results missed expectations. In terms of headline numbers, consumer spending was up 0.4% in February on the back of a downwardly revised 0.3% dip in January, per a Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) report. Consensus expectations had been for a 0.5% gain last month. Regarding inflation, the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index increased by 0.3% from the previous month. Not Much Momentum But real PCE, which is adjusted for inflation, barely recovered from January’s 0.6% decline, rising just 0.1% in February. The increase in spending was primarily driven by goods, which rose by 0.7% after falling 2.1% in the prior month. Categories such as motor vehicle parts (1.6%), furnishings and household equipment (0.7%), and food and beverages (0.7%) contributed to this growth. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Meanwhile, disposable personal income (DPI), which accounts for personal income after taxes, increased by $191.6 billion, or 0.9%. Consumers seem to be saving what they can: Despite rising consumer spending, the personal saving rate, measured as a share of disposable personal income increased to 4.6% in February, reaching $1.02 trillion. We’re well above the 3.3% saving rate that had been notched in December. As for what lies ahead: The University of Michigan released the final readings for their consumer sentiment index, which shows low spirit among consumers, as sentiment slid another 12% this month, on the back of 10% and 3% decreases in the two months prior. The accumulated drop in the first three months of 2025 amounts to 23%. As reported by PYMNTS, this drop constitutes the steepest cumulative decline in sentiment for the first quarter following a presidential election in the 21st century . Once again, declines were consistent across all demographic and political affiliations. Within the index, it is the subindex of expectations for the future that most deteriorated (18%) with uncertainty around policy continuing to be a decisive element. Two-thirds of consumers expect unemployment to rise in the year ahead, the highest reading since 2009. Assessment on current economic conditions decreased somewhat (3%) and stand 15% below December’s readings. Year-ahead inflation expectations jumped up from 4.3% last month to 5% this month, the highest reading since November 2022 and marking three consecutive months of “unusually large” increases (0.5 percentage points or more, as defined by the same report). The recent turmoil is also taking a toll on long-run inflation expectations, which surged from 3.5% in February to 4.1% in March. This is the largest month-over-month increase seen since 1993, and indicates that that the high inflation span has extended to a long enough period to generate long-term changes in consumer expectations, and likely, behaviors. The data points reported above should be sobering for merchants, as they’re faced with their own increased input costs due to tariffs, and passing along price increases will be a dicey proposition at best. This week’s (final) GDP data for the fourth quarter may represent a harbinger of continued slowing economic growth. The BEA said that real GDP showed a revised 2.4% annual increase for the last quarter of the year, which means economic activity throughout the whole of 2024 grew 2.8% compared to 2023 (unchanged from the second estimate). Q4 increases came on the back of overall jumps of 3% and 3.1% in Q2 and Q3, respectively, which shows just how things are slowing. 2024 was sustained by resilient consumer spending, which scored a 4% increase in Q4 and averaged a 2.8% growth rate over the full year. The engine of economic growth — namely, household spending — seems to be sputtering.

Photo : Grace Cary / Moment / Getty Images In February, consumer spending in the United States increased by 0.4%, following a revised 0.3% decline in January, according to data from the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. This rebound in spending, which constitutes more than two-thirds of economic activity, was largely driven by higher prices. However, inflation continues to exceed the Federal Reserve's target , posing ongoing economic challenges. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, rose by 0.3% in February, matching January's increase. On an annual basis, prices climbed by 2.5% , while core inflation, excluding food and energy, rose by 0.4% in February and 2.8% over the past 12 months. Despite these inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve has kept its benchmark interest rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range, although financial markets are anticipating a potential rate cut in June. The rise in consumer spending comes amid concerns about slow economic growth and escalating trade tensions. President Donald Trump has announced a 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks, set to take effect next week. Economists warn that these tariffs could harm economic growth, as trade partners retaliate with their own duties. Businesses and consumers have been rushing to secure imports and make purchases before the tariffs take effect, contributing to the recent spending surge. As inflationary pressures continue, the Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the situation to maintain its 2% inflation target. The central bank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged reflects its cautious approach in the face of uncertain economic conditions. Economists remain concerned about the risk of a slowdown, with first-quarter GDP estimates hovering around a 1.0% annualized growth rate.

Photo : Grace Cary / Moment / Getty Images In February, consumer spending in the United States increased by 0.4%, following a revised 0.3% decline in January, according to data from the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. This rebound in spending, which constitutes more than two-thirds of economic activity, was largely driven by higher prices. However, inflation continues to exceed the Federal Reserve's target , posing ongoing economic challenges. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, rose by 0.3% in February, matching January's increase. On an annual basis, prices climbed by 2.5% , while core inflation, excluding food and energy, rose by 0.4% in February and 2.8% over the past 12 months. Despite these inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve has kept its benchmark interest rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range, although financial markets are anticipating a potential rate cut in June. The rise in consumer spending comes amid concerns about slow economic growth and escalating trade tensions. President Donald Trump has announced a 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks, set to take effect next week. Economists warn that these tariffs could harm economic growth, as trade partners retaliate with their own duties. Businesses and consumers have been rushing to secure imports and make purchases before the tariffs take effect, contributing to the recent spending surge. As inflationary pressures continue, the Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the situation to maintain its 2% inflation target. The central bank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged reflects its cautious approach in the face of uncertain economic conditions. Economists remain concerned about the risk of a slowdown, with first-quarter GDP estimates hovering around a 1.0% annualized growth rate.

Moderate US consumer spending, increasing prices raise specter of stagflation Published on 03/28/2025 at 01:03 pm EDT Reuters Share Euro / US Dollar (EUR/USD) -0.07% WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending rebounded less than expected in February while a measure of underlying prices increased by the most in 13 months, stoking fears the economy was facing a period of tepid growth and high inflation amid an escalation in trade tensions. Those concerns were reinforced by a survey from the University of Michigan on Friday showing consumers' 12-month inflation expectations soared to the highest level in nearly 2-1/2 years in March. Even more worrisome, consumers anticipated inflation would remain elevated in the years beyond. Economists say President Donald Trump's protectionist trade agenda, marked by a rush of tariff action announcements since taking office in January, will boost prices of imported goods and drive inflation higher in the coming months. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged last week that inflation had started to rise "partly in response to tariffs," adding that "there may be a delay in further progress over the course of this year." While Powell downplayed the deteriorating inflation expectations, economists said hot underlying price pressures could deter the U.S. central bank from resuming cutting interest rates in June as anticipated by financial markets. "Today's data is only inflaming stagflation fears," said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING. "We are moving in the wrong direction and the concern is that tariffs threaten higher prices, which mean the inflation prints are going to remain hot. This will constrain the Fed's ability to deliver further interest rate cuts." Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, climbed 0.4% after a downwardly revised 0.3% decline in January, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending gaining 0.5% after a previously reported 0.2% fall in January. Spending was lifted by a 1.4% surge in outlays on long-lasting manufactured goods like motor vehicles and parts, recreational goods and vehicles as well as furniture and other durable household equipment. Spending on nondurable goods such as food and beverages also rose. But consumers are pulling back on discretionary spending. Outlays on services edged up 0.2%, with receipts at restaurants, hotels and motels dropping 15.0%. "Consumers are clearly becoming more tactical and cautious in their spending as they try to navigate this uncertain economic and inflationary environment," said Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at BMO Capital Markets. Spending at nonprofit institutions plunged 15.8% amid federal funding cuts as the Trump administration embarks on an unprecedented campaign to sharply downsize the government. Trump this week unveiled a 25% levy on imported cars and light trucks starting next week. Economists say the size and manner in which the tariffs are being handled were detrimental to economic growth. They have also criticized the often disorderly firings of thousands of federal workers by tech billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Many workers have been ordered reinstated by courts. U.S. stocks traded lower. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell. TRADE WAR With the United States' trade partners expected to retaliate through duties of their own, the risks of stagflation or worse, a recession, have increased. The well-telegraphed tariffs have sharply widened the trade deficit as businesses rushed to secure imports. Trump, who sees tariffs as a tool to raise revenue to offset his promised tax cuts and to revive a long-declining U.S. industrial base, is planning to unveil a wave of reciprocal tariffs next week. Economists, however, argue that the duties will be inflationary, a sentiment shared by consumers. Consumers' one-year inflation expectations jumped to 5.0% in March, the highest level since November 2022, the University of Michigan survey showed. That compared to 4.3% last month. Over the next five years, they saw inflation running at 4.1%, the highest reading since February 1993 and up from 3.5% in February. "Inflation expectations are the transmission mechanism in which a one-time hit to the price level from tariffs turn into a general increase across the price level or inflation," said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US. "A rational fiscal policymaker would look at the tone and tenor of the hard and soft data and conclude it's time to start cutting trade deals to limit the damage to the real economy." The BEA report showed the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index increased 0.3% in February after advancing by the same unrevised margin in January and in line with economists' expectations. There were increases in the prices of recreational goods and vehicles, and other durable goods as well as clothing and footwear. Services prices rose solidly, driven by higher costs for housing, recreation and finance. In the 12 months through February, PCE prices increased 2.5%, matching January's rise. Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index rose 0.4% in February. That was the biggest gain in the so-called core inflation since January 2024 and followed an unrevised 0.3% advance in January. In the 12 months through February, core inflation increased 2.8% after rising 2.7% in January. The Fed tracks the PCE price measures for its 2% inflation target. It last week left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged in the 4.25%-4.50% range. Following the auto tariffs, J.P. Morgan raised its core PCE inflation estimate this year to 3.1% from 2.8%. "We see much of this increase concentrated in the second quarter," said Michael Feroli, J.P. Morgan's chief U.S. economist. "The resulting squeeze on consumer real purchasing power will further weigh on real consumer spending." Consumer spending adjusted for inflation edged up 0.1% after declining 0.6% in January. That suggested consumer spending and economic growth could stall this quarter. Goldman Sachs cut its gross domestic product estimate to a 0.6% annualized rate from a 1.0% pace. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP contracting at a 2.8% rate. The economy grew at a 2.4% pace in the October-December quarter. "This report increases the chances that first-quarter real GDP growth will print with a negative sign," said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital.

This rebound in spending, which constitutes more than two-thirds of economic activity, was largely driven by higher prices. However, inflation continues to exceed the Federal Reserve's target , posing ongoing economic challenges. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, rose by 0.3% in February, matching January's increase. On an annual basis, prices climbed by 2.5% , while core inflation, excluding food and energy, rose by 0.4% in February and 2.8% over the past 12 months. Despite these inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve has kept its benchmark interest rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range, although financial markets are anticipating a potential rate cut in June. The rise in consumer spending comes amid concerns about slow economic growth and escalating trade tensions. President Donald Trump has announced a 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks, set to take effect next week. Economists warn that these tariffs could harm economic growth, as trade partners retaliate with their own duties. Businesses and consumers have been rushing to secure imports and make purchases before the tariffs take effect, contributing to the recent spending surge. As inflationary pressures continue, the Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the situation to maintain its 2% inflation target. The central bank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged reflects its cautious approach in the face of uncertain economic conditions. Economists remain concerned about the risk of a slowdown, with first-quarter GDP estimates hovering around a 1.0% annualized growth rate.

Article Content:
U.S. personal income and consumer spending both rose in February, the Commerce Department said Friday, suggesting that the economy remains resilient despite surveys showing gloomy consumer confidence. Total personal income increased by 0.8 percent, or $194.7 billion, driven largely by wage gains and transfer payments. Consumer spending rose 0.4 percent, or $87.8 billion, last month. The gain was driven by a $56.3 billion increase in goods spending and a $31.5 billion rise in services spending. Adjusted for inflation, real consumer spending increased by 0.1 percent, indicating that demand remains steady even as inflation continues to weigh on purchasing power. Manufacturing wages rose one percent percent and wages in the services sector climbed 0.4 percent growth. The robust growth in manufacturing wages comes as President Trump continues his efforts to revitalize U.S. manufacturing, a central component of his economic policy agenda aimed at boosting middle-class incomes and strengthening the industrial base. They may indicate rising demand for manufacturing workers as businesses ramp up domestic production in hopes of avoiding tariffs on imports. Disposable personal income, which measures income after taxes, rose 0.9 percent in February, while inflation-adjusted disposable income increased by 0.5 percent. The steady rise in incomes and spending is expected to support broader economic growth even as inflationary pressures continue to challenge household budgets. The latest data highlights a broader trend of economic resilience, with income and spending growth outpacing consumer sentiment. Economists have noted that wage and income growth are more reliable indicators of economic health than consumer confidence surveys, which have been pessimistic since mid-2021. Hard data continues to point to economic resilience, even as sentiment remains subdued.

President Donald Trump has announced a 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks, set to take effect next week. Economists warn that these tariffs could harm economic growth, as trade partners retaliate with their own duties. Businesses and consumers have been rushing to secure imports and make purchases before the tariffs take effect, contributing to the recent spending surge. As inflationary pressures continue, the Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the situation to maintain its 2% inflation target. The central bank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged reflects its cautious approach in the face of uncertain economic conditions. Economists remain concerned about the risk of a slowdown, with first-quarter GDP estimates hovering around a 1.0% annualized growth rate.

Photo : Grace Cary / Moment / Getty Images In February, consumer spending in the United States increased by 0.4%, following a revised 0.3% decline in January, according to data from the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. This rebound in spending, which constitutes more than two-thirds of economic activity, was largely driven by higher prices. However, inflation continues to exceed the Federal Reserve's target , posing ongoing economic challenges. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, rose by 0.3% in February, matching January's increase. On an annual basis, prices climbed by 2.5% , while core inflation, excluding food and energy, rose by 0.4% in February and 2.8% over the past 12 months. Despite these inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve has kept its benchmark interest rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range, although financial markets are anticipating a potential rate cut in June. The rise in consumer spending comes amid concerns about slow economic growth and escalating trade tensions.

Updated / Friday, 28 Mar 2025 13:27 US consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity US consumer spending rebounded in February, likely lifted by higher prices, which could amplify fears that the economy was facing a period of tepid growth and high inflation amid an escalation in trade tensions. US consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, climbed 0.4% after a revised 0.3% decline in January, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said today. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending rising 0.5% after a previously reported 0.2% fall in January. US President Donald Trump has announced a slew of tariff actions since taking office in January. Trump this week unveiled a 25% levy on imported cars and light trucks starting next week. Economists say the size and manner in which the tariffs are being handled were detrimental to economic growth. US business and consumer sentiment have deteriorated considerably, raising the risks of a recession, with the United States' trade partners expected to retaliate through duties of their own. The well telegraphed tariffs have sharply widened the trade deficit as businesses rushed to secure imports. US consumers, also eager to avoid higher prices, front-loaded their spending, much of which took place in December. The ebb in pre-emptive buying as well as unseasonably cold temperatures and snowstorms cooled spending at the start of the year. Before the data, gross domestic product estimates for the first quarter were mostly around a 1% annualised rate and the odds of a contraction have risen. The economy grew at a 2.4% pace in the October-December quarter. Trump, who sees tariffs as a tool to raise revenue to offset his promised tax cuts and to revive a long-declining US industrial base, is planning to unveil a wave of reciprocal tariffs next week. Economists, however, argue that the duties will be inflationary in the short-run. Consumers' inflation expectations have sky-rocketed. US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged last week that inflation had started to rise "partly in response to tariffs," adding that "there may be a delay in further progress over the course of this year." The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index increased 0.3% in February after advancing by an unrevised 0.3% in January. Economists had forecast the PCE price index gaining 0.3%. In the 12 months to February, prices increased 2.5%, matching January's rise. Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index rose 0.4% after an unrevised 0.3% advance in January. In the 12 months to December, core inflation increased 2.8% after rising 2.7% in January. The US Fed tracks the PCE price measures for its 2% inflation target. The Fed last week left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged in the 4.25%-4.5% range. Financial markets expect it to resume its easing cycle in June.

Skip Navigation Markets Business Investing Tech Politics Video Watchlist Investing Club PRO Livestream Menu Key Points The core personal consumption expenditures price index, a key Fed inflation measure, showed a 0.4% increase in February, putting the 12-month inflation rate at 2.8%, both higher than expected. Consumer spending accelerated 0.4% for the month, below the 0.5% forecast. That came as personal income posted a 0.8% rise, against the estimate for 0.4%. watch now VIDEO 2:54 02:54 Core inflation in February hits 2.8%, hotter than expected; spending increases 0.4% Squawk Box The Federal Reserve's key inflation measure rose more than expected in February while consumer spending also posted a smaller-than-projected increase, the Commerce Department reported Friday. The core personal consumption expenditures price index showed a 0.4% increase for the month, the biggest monthly gain since January 2024, putting the 12-month inflation rate at 2.8%. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for respective numbers of 0.3% and and 2.7%. Core inflation excludes volatile food and energy prices and is generally considered a better indicator of long-term inflation trends. In the all-items measure, the price index rose 0.3% on the month and 2.5% from a year ago, both in line with forecasts. At the same time, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed that consumer spending accelerated 0.4% for the month, below the 0.5% forecast. That came as personal income posted a 0.8% rise, against the estimate for 0.4%. Stock market futures briefly moved lower following the release, as did Treasury yields. Federal Reserve officials focus on the PCE inflation reading as they consider it a broader measure that also adjusts for changes in consumer behavior and places less of an emphasis on housing than the Labor Department's consumer price index. Shelter costs have been one of the stickier elements of inflation and rose 0.3% in the PCE measure. "It looks like a 'wait-and-see' Fed still has more waiting to do," said Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. "Today's higher-than-expected inflation reading wasn't exceptionally hot, but it isn't going to speed up the Fed's timeline for cutting interest rates, especially given the uncertainty surrounding tariffs." Good prices increased 0.2%, led by recreational goods and vehicles, which increased 0.5%. Gasoline offset some of the increase, with the category falling 0.8%. Services prices were up 0.4%. Households also grew more cautious with their money, as the personal saving rate increased to 4.6%, the highest since June 2024. The report comes with markets on edge that President Donald Trump's tariff intentions will aggravate inflation at a time when the data was making slow but steady progress back to the Fed's 2% goal. After cutting rates a full percentage point in 2024, the central bank has been on hold this year, with officials of late expressing concern over the effect the import duties will have on prices. Economists tend to consider tariffs as one-off events that do not feed through to longer-lasting inflation pressures, but the encompassing scope of Trump's tariffs and the potential for an aggressive global trade war are changing the stakes. Correction: Consumer spending increased 0.4% in February. An earlier headline misstated the number. Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange! Uncertain markets?

Reuters Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Linkedin WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. economy expanded at a healthy annual 2.4% pace the final three months of 2024, supported by a year-end surge in consumer spending, the government said Thursday in a slight upgrade of its previous estimate of fourth-quarter growth. But it's unclear whether the United States can sustain that growth as President Donald Trump wages trade wars, purges the federal workforce and promises mass deportations of immigrants working in the country illegally. Growth in gross domestic product — the nation's output of goods and services — decelerated from a 3.1% pace in July-September 2024, the Commerce Department said. For all of 2024, the economy — the world's biggest — grew 2.8%, down a tick from 2.9% in 2023. Consumer spending rose at a 4% pace, up from 3.7% in third-quarter 2023. But business investment fell, led by an 8.7% drop in investment in equipment. A drop in business inventories shaved 0.84 percentage points off fourth-quarter GDP growth. Recommended for you A category within the GDP data that measures the economy's underlying strength rose at a healthy 2.9% annual rate in the fourth quarter, slipping from the government's previous estimate of 3.2% and from 3.4% in the third quarter. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. Wednesday's report showed continued inflationary pressure at the end of 2024. The Federal Reserve's favored inflation gauge — the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index — rose at an annual rate of 2.4%, up from 1.5% in the third quarter and above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PC inflation registered 2.6%, compared to 2.2% in the third quarter. Thursday's report was the government's third and final look at fourth-quarter GDP. The outlook is cloudier. Trump's decision to slap taxes on a range of imports — including a 25% tax on foreign autos announced Wednesday — could push up inflation and disrupt investment, hurting growth. The fourth-quarter showed the U.S. economy "before the enormous surge in policy uncertainty, particularly trade, took hold and the Trump administration imposed additional tariffs," wrote Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. "The combination of policy uncertainty, tariffs, and tightening financial market conditions are weighing on growth early this year.'' U.S. consumer confidence is sliding sharpy over anxiety about both tariffs and inflation, and major retailers are lowering their expectations for the year, saying that customers are already pulling back on spending.

Automakers slump on tariff news Shares of major automakers slumped following President Donald Trump’s announcement that he will place 25% tariffs on auto imports. General Motors shed 7.4% Thursday. The Detroit automaker could be among the hardest hit of its peers under broad tariffs, as it sources about 40% of vehicles sold in the U.S. from Mexico and Canada, according to analysts at JPMorgan. Ford, which slipped 3.9%, is less exposed with under 10% of vehicles sourced outside of the U.S., JPMorgan said. Stellantis, which is based in the Netherlands but has significant manufacturing operations in North America, fell 1.3%. Honda shares traded in the U.S. fell 2.2% and Toyota shares traded in the U.S. fell 2.5%. One exception was Tesla. Its shares edged up 0.4%.

However, business investment and inventories saw a decline. Inflationary pressures increased, and the outlook for 2025 is uncertain due to tariffs and trade policies under President Donald Trump. Consumer confidence has dropped, potentially impacting future growth. US economy (Photo-AP) The US economy expanded at a healthy annual rate of 2.4% in the final quarter of 2024, according to a slight upgrade in the government’s growth estimate released on Thursday. The growth was driven by a strong year-end surge in consumer spending , despite challenges posed by a slowdown in business investment and declining inventories. The increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was down from a 3.1% pace in the third quarter, signalling a deceleration in growth. The overall 2024 economy grew by 2.8%, slightly down from 2.9% in 2023, news agency AP reported. Consumer spending was a key driver, growing at a 4% pace in the fourth quarter, up from 3.7% in the third quarter. However, business investment fell, with a notable 8.7% drop in investment in equipment. A decline in business inventories contributed to a 0.84 percentage point reduction in GDP growth for the quarter. A key measure of the economy's underlying strength, which excludes volatile components such as exports, inventories, and government spending, showed a healthy 2.9% annual growth rate in Q4, slightly revised down from the previous estimate of 3.2%. This was also lower than the 3.4% pace recorded in Q3. While consumer spending provided a boost, inflationary pressures continued to rise toward the end of 2024. The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose at an annual rate of 2.4%, up from 1.5% in the third quarter and exceeding the Fed's 2% target. Core PCE inflation , which excludes volatile food and energy prices, registered 2.6%, up from 2.2% in the prior quarter. Despite the strong finish to 2024, the outlook for 2025 remains uncertain, particularly with the trade policies of President Donald Trump . His decision to impose new tariffs — including a 25% tax on imported cars — could lead to higher inflation and disrupt business investment, threatening future growth. The fourth-quarter GDP data reflects the economy before the surge in policy uncertainty and trade tensions escalated, particularly under Trump’s administration. As Ryan Sweet, Chief US Economist at Oxford Economics, noted, "The combination of policy uncertainty, tariffs, and tightening financial market conditions are weighing on growth early this year." In addition to trade concerns, US consumer confidence has dropped sharply, driven by fears of inflation and the impact of tariffs. Major retailers have adjusted their expectations for 2025, with some warning that consumers are already curbing their spending. As the year progresses, the economic landscape could face additional challenges from both domestic and international pressures.

Aryaman Gupta March 27, 2025 / 10:11 IST With 280 mn online shoppers, India pips US to become 2nd largest e-retail market globally: Flipkart-Bain report With almost 28 crore online shoppers, India has overtaken the US to become the world’s second largest e-retail market in terms of online buyers, behind China, a 2024 report by Flipkart and Bain and Company has said. China had 92 crore e-retail shoppers while the US had 27 crore. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20 percent between 2019 to 2024, the e-retail market in India scaled to $60 billion last year, and is projected to reach $170–190 billion by 2030, the report said. This comes even as growth in domestic e-retail has slowed down to 10-12 percent during the year compared to over 20 percent seen historically, due to macroeconomic factors and a consumption slump. Regardless, nearly one in 10 retail dollars is projected to be spent on e-retail by 2030, fuelled by an uptick in discretionary spending, as India’s GDP per capita looks to cross the crucial $3,500–4,000 threshold, a key tipping point in e-retail spend globally.

While the e-retail market in India is largely dominated by players like Amazon and Flipkart, newer entrants like Meesho - with its tier II and beyond focus - have expanded the market. Meanwhile, emerging quick commerce challengers like Blinkit, Zepto and Swiggy Instamart have helped increase the overall e-commerce pie. As per the report, growth in India’s e-retail market will be driven by further expansion into remote markets, rising discretionary spending, and the growing contribution of high-frequency categories. Emerging sectors like quick commerce are also expected to have a disruptive impact on the market. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad India’s e-retail penetration has already expanded from tier II cities to tier III and smaller cities, with almost 60 percent of new customers since 2020 hailing from tier III towns and smaller cities. Additionally, over 60 percent of the new sellers onboarded on e-retail platforms since 2021 were from tier II and smaller cities. “E-retail spending of shoppers in Tier-2 and smaller cities is broadly at par with that of Metro/Tier-I cities, with similar or only slightly lower average selling prices across categories,” the Flipkart-Bain report stated. This growth is driven by faster delivery options, cash-on-delivery availability, and e-retail ads serving as indicators of quality. As such, the long-term prospects of India’s e-retail market remain strong, despite near-term macroeconomic headwinds, the report concluded.

Title: Canadian consumer spending held up ok in February - RBC

Article Content:
This report is more useful when it's released before Canadian retail sales but RBC is out today with its latest data on Canadian cardholder spending. Canada's largest bank said card transactions fell 0.2% in February, which is largely consistent with the -0.4% decline in the advance retail sales report. Sales were influenced by poor February weather and the HST holiday through Feb 15. Overall though, there is tremendous angst in Canada but few indications of changed consumer behaviour. "Spending on discretionary goods declined in February, but spending on discretionary services and essentials were little changed from January. Sales at restaurants edged higher—broadly consistent with data from OpenTable showing restaurant bookings still running 20% above year-ago levels into late March" They also note that Ontario has recently doled out $200 stimulus cheques to every person in the province and that province leads the annual rise in spending. Overall, it's all a puzzle with Canadian consumer confidence at generational lows but consumer spending just fine. It's a similar dynamic in the US and elsewhere.

Article Content:
Photo : cyano66 / iStock / Getty Images The Consumer Confidence Index has dropped to its lowest level since January 2021 , reflecting growing concerns among U.S. consumers about the state of the economy. This decline indicates that Americans are increasingly worried about economic conditions, job security, and personal finances. According to The Conference Board, which tracks consumer sentiment, this drop in confidence is linked to various economic challenges. These include rising inflation, fluctuating job markets , and concerns over financial stability. The index serves as a key indicator of consumer spending, which is a significant driver of the U.S. economy. The report found that consumers are very pessimistic about the short-term outlook for the economy, with the Expectations Index falling to a 12-year low of 65.2. That is well below a score of 80, which usually indicates a recession is on the horizon. "Consumers’ expectations were especially gloomy, with pessimism about future business conditions deepening and confidence about future employment prospects falling to a 12-year low. Meanwhile, consumers’ optimism about future income—which had held up quite strongly in the past few months—largely vanished, suggesting worries about the economy and labor market have started to spread into consumers’ assessments of their personal situations," said Stephanie Guichard , Senior Economist, Global Indicators at The Conference Board . The Conference Board provides insights into how consumer confidence affects economic activities. When confidence is low, consumers tend to reduce spending, which can lead to slower economic growth. This trend is concerning for businesses and policymakers who rely on consumer spending to fuel economic expansion.

Title: S & P 500 : Investors Find Ways To Profit From Trump Global Arms Race
Date: 20250327T134500Z
URL: https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-investors-find-ways-to-profit-from-trumps-global-arms-race/
Source: investors.com

Article Content:
President Donald Trump's moves to rip up the world's military alliances are creating ways for investors to profit in S&P 500 stocks using ETFs. Six of the eight largest defense and aerospace ETFs, including iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ( ITA ), Invesco Aerospace & Defense ( PPA ) and SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ( XAR ), are outperforming the S&P 500 this year, says an Investor's Business Daily analysis of data from ETFdb and MarketSurge . And the entire group of eight ETFs is up an average of nearly 7%, while the S&P 500 is down 3% this year so far, says S&P Global Market Intelligence. "The rise in global military expenditures has driven strong performance in defense stocks," said Taylor Krystkowiak, vice president and investment strategist at Themes ETFs. A New World Order? Trump has made it clear he's no longer interested in protecting many of the U.S.' allies. And he is expecting countries, especially in Europe, to spend more on their own defense. And that's prompting major shifts. NATO members excluding the U.S. are forecast to spend $380 billion on defense this year. And 23 countries are positioned to spend 2% of their GDP on defense, an all-time high, Krystkowiak says. The result is an expected boom in defense spending — already showing up in the shares of the defense ETFs. U.S. defense stocks are in the major indexes, but are not a major component. "Investors have modest exposure to aerospace and defense companies in a broad U.S. equity market ETF tied to the S&P 500 or the Russell 1000 indexes," said Todd Rosenbluth of TMX VettaFi. "The industry is part of the industrial sector but is relatively small compared to the information technology sector." ETFs can fortify portfolios' exposure to defense, though. But not all defense and aerospace ETFs are alike. Picking The Top Defense ETFs The biggest winner so far is the $1.2 billion-in-assets Global X Defense Tech ETF ( SHLD ). Shares are up nearly 27% this year, mainly due to the exposure to the wave of European spending. The ETF owns European defense giants like Germany's Rheinmetall ( RHM ) in addition to U.S. firms. Global X Defense Tech holds an 8.7% position in Rheinmetall. The German company provides a wide range of defense supplies ranging from munition to armored vehicles. Shares have more than doubled in value this year. Analysts think the company will make $31.84 a share this year, up nearly 70% from 2024. Another large European holding in the fund is France's Thales, which trades on the Euronext Paris exchange. It, too, makes a variety of defense products ranging from flight decks to drones. It's a 6.2% position in the ETF. Shares are up more than 80% this year. But Global X Defense Tech also holds shares of U.S. defense stocks like Palantir Technologies ( PLTR ). The maker of defense software is up more than 20% this year. And it's a 9.7% position in the fund — making it the largest holding. Other Options To Choose From IShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense, Invesco Aerospace & Defense and SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense are the largest defense ETFs by assets. But they take different approaches. IShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense and Invesco Aerospace & Defense "are more concentrated in large cap stocks like Boeing ( BA ) and Lockheed Martin ( LMT )," Rosenbluth said. Boeing is the third-largest position in iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense at roughly 10%, says Morningstar. SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense takes a slightly different tactic. It holds smaller defense stocks like Archer Aviation ( ACHR ) and Rocket Lab USA ( RKLB ), too. "There are more targeted industry ETFs that can be used to augment diversified funds. However there are differences between them," Rosenbluth said. Largest Defense ETFs Most top the S&P 500 this year so far ETF Symbol Assets ($ billions) YTD ch. iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ITA $6.5 8.0% Invesco Aerospace & Defense PPA 4.7 4.0% SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense XAR 2.7 0.5% Global X Defense Tech SHLD 1.2 26.8% ARK Space Exploration & Innovation ARKX 0.3 -3.5% Direxion Daily Aerospace & Defense Bull 3X DFEN 0.2 20.4% SPDR S&P Kensho Future Security FITE 0.09 -2.5% U.S. Global Technology and Aerospace & Defense WAR 0.003 0.8% Sources: ETFdb, S&P Global Market Intelligence, IBD Follow Matt Krantz on X (Twitter) @ mattkrantz YOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Five Reasons To Watch This Palantir Peer.

Video-based Manufacturing Awareness Program is through Let’s Go Aerospace Magazine and its parent company, Top Drawer Media. "The publication and the M.A.P. videos' short-term goals are to inspire more youth to consider careers in advanced manufacturing," a press release said. "In the long term, Top Drawer Media will partner with advanced manufacturing companies, state government, and educational institutions to bring more hands-on tours to middle and high schools in the Pacific Northwest." The aerospace industry is rising in career potential in North Idaho. The American Aerospace Materials Manufacturing Center may become a reality through the U.S. Department of Commerce Tech Hub award and industry commitments of over $50 million.

(AP) — A private lunar lander has captured the first high-definition sunset pictures from the moon. Firefly Aerospace and NASA released the stunning photos Tuesday, taken before the Blue Ghost lander fell silent over the weekend. One shot included Venus in the distance. Firefly’s Blue Ghost landed on the moon on March 2, the first private spacecraft to touch down upright and perform its entire mission. It kept taking pictures and collecting science data five hours into the lunar night before it died for lack of solar energy.

(NASA/Firefly Aerospace via AP) NASA’s Joel Kearns said Blue Ghost’s series of sunset shots are the first high-resolution images from Earth’s neighbor. Scientists will need to analyze them in depth, he noted, before making any determination about the horizon glow captured in at least one of the photos and whether it was created by levitating dust. That theory was put forth more than a half-century ago by Apollo 17’s Gene Cernan, the last astronaut to walk on the moon. “What we’ve got is a really beautiful, aesthetic image showing some really unusual features,” Kearns said at a news conference.

While all objectives were met, officials said, the on-board drill could only penetrate 3 feet (1 meter) into the moon versus the 10 feet (3 meters) that had been planned.

"Military facilities are an important component of national defense construction, serving as the foundation of the military to fulfill its missions, and providing crucial support for national strategic capabilities and military operations," the Supreme People's Court said on Wednesday. "The disclosure of the cases not only emphasizes the significance of protecting military facilities, but also demonstrates the steadfast determination and relentless efforts of Chinese courts in safeguarding national defense interests," it added. It revealed that crimes involving the destruction of military facilities, such as military optical cables, have occurred from time to time in recent years. "Such actions endanger military security and affecting the military ability to carry out its missions, so they must be severely punished," it noted. One disclosed case showed that a defendant surnamed Xu was sentenced to 18 months in prison for the crime of sabotage of military communications. Xu, who worked for an information technology company, was responsible for the daily inspection and maintenance of optical cable lines. He used metal pliers to cut a military optical cable during one inspection with the intention of selling it, causing the interruption of critical business systems for over two hours and disrupting military communications for three units that were conducting exercises. Xu's actions resulted in economic losses of more than 40,000 yuan ($5,490), and the loss of the involved optical cable amounted to over 9,000 yuan. "Military communication is the method by which the armed forces use communication tools or other means to transmit information for command purposes," the top court said, stressing that military optical cables are vital military communication facilities. "In the information age, the damage to military optical cables can have significant adverse effects on military communications and activities, not only causing financial losses but also severely influencing the readiness and training of troops, thereby endangering national defense interests and national security," it added. It praised the conviction and sentence given to Xu, noting that the ruling has shown the judicial high-pressure on those who harm national defense interests and military combat effectiveness. While requiring courts nationwide to continue the fight against such crime, it has also called on more people from all walks of life to strengthen the protection of military facilities.

Title: Military Spouses Exempt from  Return to Office  Executive Order

Generate Key Takeaways Military spouses who work remotely for the federal government are now exempt from an executive order issued Jan. 20 by President Donald Trump that ended remote options for most agencies and departments. Office of Personnel Management Acting Director Charles Ezell issued a memo Wednesday announcing that spouses of active-duty personnel who work remotely are "categorically exempt" from a requirement that federal workers return to their offices five days a week. The new memo clarifies a footnote in a Jan. 27 Office of Management and Budget announcement that said agencies should "exclude military spouses working remotely based on the Military Spouse Employment Act." Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Read Next: Over $151 Million Taken from Soldiers' Paychecks for Food Costs Spent Elsewhere by the Army The memo says military spouses "shall" be allowed to work remotely regardless of whether they were hired under the law or by another means. It also allows agencies to accommodate military spouses for remote work across the federal workforce as they relocate. Debbie McGee, the wife of an Army retiree and founder of a human resources company, said the ability to work remotely is essential for military spouses to maintain careers and contribute to household income in an economy that largely requires two salaries to raise a family. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement "The days of 'hey, your spouse is in the military, you don't have to work' are long gone. You have to have dual income now," McGee said in an interview Friday with Military.com. "You have a huge population that are problem solvers [and] can pivot at the drop of a pen. They don't need to be directed. … They are perfect for remote work. Why wouldn't you [let them]?" She added that some military spouses feared they would lose their jobs if they were required to return to office or if they moved with their spouses to a new duty station. "They have made a commitment to stand behind the soldier and support the United States by following them" McGee said. "That's a huge patriotic act. Sometimes, I think the population does not realize the sacrifice the entire family makes." According to the memo, the exemption applies to the spouses of active-duty personnel, including activated Guard or reserve members, but it does not include the spouses of reservists attending training or school.

Military spouse employment became a priority for the executive branch under first lady Michelle Obama, who cofounded an initiative, Joining Forces, to provide military families with employment, wellness and education. Portions of the Military Spouse Employment Act were included in the fiscal 2024 National Defense Authorization Act, giving military spouses the opportunity to work remotely for federal agencies. Reps. Rob Wittman, R-Va., and Eugene Vindman, D-Va., have led a bipartisan effort in the past week to push for the return-to-work exemption for military spouses. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Wittman said military families make sacrifices with frequent relocations and deserve the exemption. "Standing by our military families isn't just the right thing to do -- it's patriotic and simply common sense. I thank the administration for their decision to amend this executive order," Wittman said in a news release Thursday. "Today, I am celebrating a win for military families after the administration heeded our bipartisan call to exempt military spouses from the return to in-person work order," Vindman added in the release.

Title: Federal military spouse workers exempt from return - to - office rule

Article Content:
Federally employed military spouses who work remotely are now “categorically exempt” from the return-to-office directive issued by President Donald Trump, according to new guidance clarifying the policy. Federal agencies “shall” allow military spouses to continue working remotely, and agencies may continue appointing spouses to remote work positions, according to a memo issued Wednesday by Charles Ezell, acting director of the Office of Personnel Management, or OPM. The new guidance clarifies a Jan. 27 memo from OPM and the Office of Management and Budget that included a footnote stating agencies “should also exclude military spouses working remotely based on the Military Spouse Employment Act” from the return-to-office requirement. The Jan. 27 memo directed agencies to prepare plans to return all eligible employees to in-person work, with exceptions for those excused for compelling reasons certified by the agency head and employee supervisor. It further noted military spouses working remotely had a compelling reason not to return to in-person work and agencies “should” exempt them from the requirement. In the wake of the Jan. 27 memo, some military spouses with federal jobs experienced uncertainty and angst about the new policy requiring in-person work. Advocates were concerned the guidance didn’t explicitly require federal agencies to exempt military spouses from the return-to-office requirement, potentially leading to inconsistent policies across agencies. Being able to work remotely, whether in the continental U.S. or overseas , allows military spouses to continue their careers despite frequent moves to new duty stations with their service members. Working remotely opens up more opportunities for military spouses who can be appointed to remote work positions. Military spouses have long battled problems with unemployment , largely associated with these frequent moves. The military spouse unemployment rate has remained stubbornly above 20%, according to Defense Department surveys. The new guidance applies to spouses of active-duty members, spouses of deceased service members who died while on active duty and haven’t remarried and spouses of disabled service members who retired or otherwise left the service with a 100% disability rating. It also applies to spouses of U.S. Foreign Service members on overseas assignments. The guidance also clarifies that agencies must allow military spouses to continue working remotely regardless of whether they were appointed under the Military Spouse Employment Act and covers those appointed under other appropriate hiring authorities. That applies to future appointments of military spouses to remote work positions.

Share Your Feedback Choose News18 on Google reset China President Xi Jinping China has unveiled sweeping new regulations to tighten the release of information about its military online, a move that could obscure key sources for monitoring the world’s largest armed forces. The rules, announced over the weekend and taking effect on March 1, come as China is rapidly building up and modernizing its People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to match the military might of the United States. Recommended Stories It also marks the latest step in leader Xi Jinping’s far-reaching campaign to bolster national security and guard state secrets in the face of heightened geopolitical tensions – efforts that have made it all the more difficult for foreign observers to understand what is happening in China. The all-encompassing rules could have a big impact on Chinese military bloggers and commentators, who are often quick to share images or information about new weapons systems, personnel appointments and troop movements. Such publicly available information posted by Chinese military enthusiasts has also been an important source for PLA watchers to track the development and movement of the Chinese military. The regulations are aimed at addressing issues including “the spread of false military information" and “the leakage of military secrets" on the internet, according to a Q&A released by the government. They lay out strict rules for online content about military affairs, banning the “producing, copying, publishing and disseminating" of military secrets, national defense technology and industry secrets or other undisclosed information. The banned list covers everything from the development and testing of weapons systems to military drills and deployment, as well as the organizational structures, tasks and combat capabilities of military units that have not been officially disclosed. Joseph Wen, a Taipei-based independent analyst who documents publicly available intelligence about the PLA, said the ruling Chinese Communist Party has always been defined by a high degree of opacity. “However, as a regime that values both secrecy and propaganda, Chinese authorities have long taken a ‘wink and nod’ approach toward the dissemination of information related to the PLA within domestic online communities," he said. The new rules signal that Beijing is beginning to abandon this approach and establish clear boundaries for “guarding secrets," Wen added. The regulations target individual users and “online military information service providers," which include dedicated military affairs websites, military columns and social media accounts focused on the military. In a sign of their sweeping scope, the regulations were issued jointly by 10 government and Communist Party departments, from the top internet regulator and top military commanding body to the ministries of public security, state security and culture and tourism. Open source information has provided key clues about China’s military progress in the past. Last December, online footage and images of what many believed to be China’s next-generation stealth fighter jet caused a huge stir in both China and the overseas PLA watching community, after the mysterious aircraft were seen flying in broad daylight over two Chinese cities. It’s unclear how the new rules will affect foreign media reporting on the Chinese military. Analysts said the new regulations could portend a tightening of control over military-themed content on the Chinese internet. “Military and defense-related content enjoys significant popularity among Chinese internet users, but the leadership is clearly keen to ensure that sensitive information — a concept broadly applied in China — and speculation do not undermine the official narrative around the country’s military development and capabilities," wrote David Bandurski, executive director of the China Media Project. James Char, a PLA expert and assistant professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said information related to the PLA and other military matters have long been placed under strict supervision by Chinese authorities. Some of the content banned by the new rules had already been outlawed in previous legislations, such as anything that harms national sovereignty and security or denigrate the military and its “heroes and martyrs." Others are routinely censored on Chinese social media, such as comments criticizing China’s national defense policy and military strategy, or those spreading false information about the military. “I regard the announcement of these regulations as nothing more than the institutionalization of existing rules," Char said. But he noted that the new rules banning the sharing of information on military deployments and troop movements do serve to outlaw such practices by internet users without PLA approval, such as military bloggers or the man on the street in China. “This may have an effect on these individuals’ readiness to post such material online the next time they come across troop movements or a military exercise in their localities," Char said. “This will also work in Beijing’s interest in preventing its troop deployments within the mainland from being exposed in advance of another major military exercise or troop build-up in China’s coastal regions off the Taiwan Strait." top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all Wen, the PLA watcher in Taipei, said the new regulations could also be partially a response to the growth of online open-source intelligence community, but PLA observers still have plenty of opportunities to gather data from official propaganda sources. “The official PLA media outlets remain some of the most prolific military media in the world," he said.

Business 0 Comments A Christchurch aerospace company has successfully launched its solar-powered aircraft from Banks Peninsula into the stratosphere for the first time. Taking off from the Tāwhaki National Aerospace Centre near Birdlings Flat, the Kea Atmos Mk1b UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) completed the milestone flight on Saturday. Mark Rocket. Photo: Kea Aerospace The flight, conducted within Kea Aerospace's special use airspace, reached an altitude of over 56,284ft (17155m). Kea Aerospace chief executive Mark Rocket said it marks another significant achievement for New Zealand’s aerospace sector. The mission started just after 8am and the flight lasted 8hr 20min. The plane flew 18.9 nautical miles (35km) from the take-off area, covering a total distance of 420km, before touching down again on the peninsula just before 5.30pm. Rocket said flying in the stratosphere puts the UAV above the weather, high winds and other aircraft and allows the solar powered UAV to fly continuously for several months. "The use of solar power eliminates the need for refuelling, significantly reducing the Kea Atmos’ carbon footprint. "The aircraft is designed to carry payloads for earth observation, telecommunications and technology testing. "A key focus is on aerial imagery applications, including environmental monitoring, maritime domain awareness, precision agriculture and disaster response. The Kea Atmos solar-powered aircraft. Photo: Kea Aerospace "This stratospheric flight puts Kea Aerospace alongside just a handful of other international companies that can achieve solar-powered flight to high altitudes. "It’s not an easy enterprise to balance the aerodynamic, power and weight allowances for this type of aircraft, whilst flying in conditions of -50 deg C with only 10% of the air density we experience at sea level. "Kudos and congratulations to our CTO, Dr Philipp Sueltrop and the Kea Aerospace team, it’s a phenomenal result to join the rarified stratospheric club." The Kea Atmos Mk1 has a 12.5m wingspan and weighs less than 40kg. It is designed for dawn-to-dusk missions. Rocket said Kea Aerospace will continue to conduct stratospheric flights with the UAV, carrying payloads for government and commercial customers. Kea Aerospace will also start the design phase for its larger Kea Atmos Mk2 aircraft this year. The Mk2 will be able to make multi-month endurance flights. Said Rocket: "We feel very fortunate to do our aerospace R&D work in New Zealand, we have been extremely well supported by entities such as the Tāwhaki National Aerospace Centre, Civil Aviation Authority, Airways, Callaghan Innovation, the New Zealand Space Agency and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. Thank you for enabling us to make this happen.” Star News Related Stories SUBSCRIBER Liquidators sell division of photo firm SUBSCRIBER Distillery diversifies into ‘bread whisky’ Consumer NZ names and shames in latest 'Yeah Nah' awards Beef mince price soars 17.5% 'Talent-short' job market to cost employers more Impressive haul for CrestClean at awards SUBSCRIBER Different strengths to follow ‘big footsteps’ Callaghan Innovation redundancies top $10m Calder Stewart eyes future as firm marks 70th SUBSCRIBER Speculation swirls over job losses at milk plant Shift to facility part of $20m expansion Large pets grounded on some domestic flights More

Analysts said the new regulations could portend a tightening of control over military-themed content on the Chinese internet. “Military and defense-related content enjoys significant popularity among Chinese internet users, but the leadership is clearly keen to ensure that sensitive information — a concept broadly applied in China — and speculation do not undermine the official narrative around the country’s military development and capabilities,” wrote David Bandurski, executive director of the China Media Project. James Char, a PLA expert and assistant professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said information related to the PLA and other military matters have long been placed under strict supervision by Chinese authorities.

Now he’s going after his own men Some of the content banned by the new rules had already been outlawed in previous legislations, such as anything that harms national sovereignty and security or denigrate the military and its “heroes and martyrs.” Others are routinely censored on Chinese social media, such as comments criticizing China’s national defense policy and military strategy, or those spreading false information about the military. “I regard the announcement of these regulations as nothing more than the institutionalization of existing rules,” Char said. But he noted that the new rules banning the sharing of information on military deployments and troop movements do serve to outlaw such practices by internet users without PLA approval, such as military bloggers or the man on the street in China. “This may have an effect on these individuals’ readiness to post such material online the next time they come across troop movements or a military exercise in their localities,” Char said. “This will also work in Beijing’s interest in preventing its troop deployments within the mainland from being exposed in advance of another major military exercise or troop build-up in China’s coastal regions off the Taiwan Strait.” Wen, the PLA watcher in Taipei, said the new regulations could also be partially a response to the growth of online open-source intelligence community, but PLA observers still have plenty of opportunities to gather data from official propaganda sources. “The official PLA media outlets remain some of the most prolific military media in the world,” he said.

This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways China has unveiled sweeping new regulations to tighten the release of information about its military online, a move that could obscure key sources for monitoring the world’s largest armed forces. The rules , announced over the weekend and taking effect on March 1, come as China is rapidly building up and modernizing its People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to match the military might of the United States. It also marks the latest step in leader Xi Jinping’s far-reaching campaign to bolster national security and guard state secrets in the face of heightened geopolitical tensions – efforts that have made it all the more difficult for foreign observers to understand what is happening in China. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The all-encompassing rules could have a big impact on Chinese military bloggers and commentators, who are often quick to share images or information about new weapons systems, personnel appointments and troop movements. Such publicly available information posted by Chinese military enthusiasts has also been an important source for PLA watchers to track the development and movement of the Chinese military. The regulations are aimed at addressing issues including “the spread of false military information” and “the leakage of military secrets” on the internet, according to a Q&A released by the government. They lay out strict rules for online content about military affairs, banning the “producing, copying, publishing and disseminating” of military secrets, national defense technology and industry secrets or other undisclosed information. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The banned list covers everything from the development and testing of weapons systems to military drills and deployment, as well as the organizational structures, tasks and combat capabilities of military units that have not been officially disclosed. Joseph Wen, a Taipei-based independent analyst who documents publicly available intelligence about the PLA, said the ruling Chinese Communist Party has always been defined by a high degree of opacity. “However, as a regime that values both secrecy and propaganda, Chinese authorities have long taken a ‘wink and nod’ approach toward the dissemination of information related to the PLA within domestic online communities,” he said. The new rules signal that Beijing is beginning to abandon this approach and establish clear boundaries for “guarding secrets,” Wen added. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The regulations target individual users and “online military information service providers,” which include dedicated military affairs websites, military columns and social media accounts focused on the military. In a sign of their sweeping scope, the regulations were issued jointly by 10 government and Communist Party departments, from the top internet regulator and top military commanding body to the ministries of public security, state security and culture and tourism. Open source information has provided key clues about China’s military progress in the past.

Article Content:
IANS Shivakumar Deputy CM DK Shivakumar on Monday urged Defence Minister Rajnath Singh to consider offering incentives to investments in aircraft and helicopter manufacturing in Karnataka recognising the state’s rich talent pool and a robust aerospace ecosystem. The incentives to manufacturers would help the state retain its talented professionals and prevent a brain drain, the Dy CM said, speaking at the inaugural of Aero India 2025 . Karnataka, Shivakumar said, played a crucial role in India’s aerospace sector, making up 67% of the country’s aircraft and helicopter manufacturing for defence services and 65% of India’s aerospace-related exports. Bengaluru was home to over 60% of the country’s aerospace manufacturing and defence research steered by major organizations like HAL , ISRO, and Boeing India etc. Over 150,000 people work in Bengaluru’s aerospace sector, making the city a global leader in aviation and defence technology, he said. The defence and aerospace industry faced a big gap despite these impressive gains. While aircraft servicing and repair were well-established in India, the manufacturing of aircraft and helicopters was yet to take off. Live Events Most of the aircraft and helicopters used in India were imported ones, he said, while building a case for sops for domestic manufacturing. Karnataka, the Dy CM said, was the first state to announce an aerospace policy in 2013. “Our state has also set up a dedicated aerospace park in 1000 acres near Devanahalli for aerospace companies.” Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

Advertisement Beijing said the rules were designed to protect defence sources and the People’s Liberation Army’s public image, but they may mean it will be harder to monitor the development and evolution of China’s military. From March 1 “online military information providers” will be banned from “producing, copying, publishing, or disseminating” previously undisclosed information, including details of weapon systems and military facilities. The new rules ban the publication of information involving “military and national defence technology secrets”. These include information about “research and development, production, testing, transportation, equipment status and the maintenance of weapons and equipment, [as well as] the tactical and technical performance of weapons and equipment”. It also bans the release of information about the armed forces’ organisational structure, its chain of command, previous commanders and details about military units that have not been officially disclosed. Advertisement The rules also took aim at “false military information and the leakage of military secrets on the internet”, according to the PLA’s official social media accounts. They were outlined in a document signed by the Cyberspace Administration of China, the political work department of the Central Military Commission and other departments, which was made public on Saturday.

Photo: Bloomberg By Aaron Tu and Shelley Shan / Staff reporters Military personnel are prohibited from uploading military or personal data, or restricted information to ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek （深度求索） or any other generative artificial intelligence （AI） services, the Ministry of National Defense said. 請繼續往下閱讀... It also banned the use of the Taiwanese-developed Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence Dialogue Engine and Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology’s ANILA, which was specifically designed to handle military affairs. Due to their diverse and powerful functions, generative AI platforms can gather a massive amount of data from users and learn about them to improve or create new products, the ministry said. Any reckless use of AI platforms could lead to leaks of confidential military information, compromise personal data safety and infringe upon intellectual property rights, it said. Military personnel are not allowed to upload military information, personal data or any information with restricted access to any generative AI platform, nor are they allowed to produce official documents using the services, it said. As generative AI platforms can produce inaccurate or vague results, all military personnel should carefully scrutinize and verify information found on generative AI platforms before using them, it said, adding that they are also strictly forbidden to use generative AI platforms to engage in illegal activities or disrupt social order. Personnel who leak confidential military information or damage the reputation of the military would face legal consequences, the ministry said. Separately, the ministry said it is intensifying efforts to crack down on etomidate use after the Executive Yuan listed it as a Category 2 narcotic in November last year. The substance, also known as “zombie vapes” when used in e-cigarettes, is a type of central nervous system depressant that can induce anesthesia. In November last year, a military conscript was found with 50 tablets of etomidate during a security search. Last year, the military used sniffer dogs to crack down on illegal drugs on military premises 525 times, Deputy Minister of National Defense Huang Yu-min （黃佑民） said in a meeting at the end of last year to review the military’s efforts to prevent hazards caused by narcotics. A specialist from the National Police Agency was invited to address military personnel in the meeting on ways to deter the abuse of etomidate. “The military is responsible for safeguarding national security, and drug prevention cannot be relaxed,” Huang said, adding that all military units would continue to bolster anti-drug efforts, strengthen awareness of law and discipline among officers and soldiers, and maintain the purity of troops. 新聞來源： TAIPEI TIMES 免費訂閱 《自由體育》電子報 熱門賽事、球星動態不漏接 不用抽 不用搶 現在用APP看新聞 保證天天中獎 點我下載APP 按我看活動辦法 相關新聞 焦點今日熱門 看更多！請加入自由時報粉絲團 網友回應

In this June 19, 2017, file photo, a person types on a laptop keyboard in North Andover, Mass. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) Military.com | By Jennifer Barnhill Published February 05, 2025 at 10:56am ET Jennifer Barnhill is a columnist for Military.com writing about military families. Military spouse unemployment has been around 20% for half a century. In recent years opportunities such as telework have provided a solution to the high mobility of military life, allowing spouses to retain their jobs through military moves. However, the recent return-to-work order issued by the Trump administration has military spouse s, who can't show up to work, wondering whether they still have jobs. On Jan. 20, the Trump administration issued an executive order canceling remote federal employment, mandating employees to return to the office. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issued a direction to federal agencies requiring them to come up with a plan to implement the order, allowing some agency flexibility. In its first memo, OPM did not include military spouses as an exempt group. While researching this article, I spoke with a dozen spouses about the impact this executive order has already had on their families. Guidance has trickled out to employees in a piecemeal fashion. Spouses shared individual agency memos from Health and Human Services and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), memos that named military spouses as exempt from this order. According to a DoD memo dated Jan. 24 reviewed by Military.com, the DoD did not explicitly indicate that military spouses were exempt from this change. Instead, it deferred to the service branches to make that call. However, OPM -- in collaboration with the Office of Management and Budget (OBM) -- released a follow-up memo on Jan. 27, stating: "Agencies should also exclude military spouses working remotely." The DoD later revised its memo on Jan. 31 to reflect this change, which is due in large part to military spouses working behind the scenes to remind leaders of existing protections. But military spouse teleworkers are unsure whether this applies to them. While both remote work and telework offer similar flexibilities to military spouses, they are different. Remote work is a job that is established as a position that does not need to report to a central office. Telework is an agreement between an employee and an agency that allows them to take what was originally an in-person job and work from home. But these definitions have been called into question in recent weeks. Katie, who asked that she only be identified by her first name because she worried about how speaking out will impact her employment, started working in federal service three years ago. Two years into her time in her job, her supervisor left his position. As military spouses do, Katie advocated for herself and pitched the idea of her moving up into his position. This required her to also negotiate a telework position. She did what she was supposed to do: She found a way to move up in her career while moving with the military. It is unclear if the "remote" military spouse exemption applies to her because her job isn't remote. She's a permanent teleworker. "There's a lot of misunderstanding right now, and a lot of misconceptions," Maria Donnelly, a military family advocate, said. "Military spouses oftentimes have no choice but to work for the federal government, because bases are in places where the military or the government is the only game in town." Donnelly left her federal career to work for a civilian employer who guaranteed her remote employment. She said remote work was the only way she could be employed and get to live in the same location as her spouse. She has since dedicated herself to helping military spouses navigate the ups and downs of federal employment. Given this shake-up, this advocacy is needed all the more. Politicians on both sides of the aisle, along with DoD and civilian leaders, have previously branded the federal government as the "employer of choice" for military spouses, publicly acknowledging the relationship between employing military spouses and military readiness. But let's get something straight: This relationship is no handout. Military spouses are a highly educated addition to the federal workforce, an addition that strengthens the financial readiness of the force. Since the release of the return-to-office order, Donnelly has heard from countless spouses who are not only worried about their jobs, they are also concerned about the impact that the policy would have on their family's decision to remain in service. "I've had multiple spouses call me crying, convinced they're about to lose their jobs," Donnelly said. "The misconception is that military families can survive on one income, but we can't. It's becoming too expensive to serve." We are living in a two-income economy. Everyone, including the government, is looking for ways to save money and be more efficient. This is why the omission of military spouses as an exception in both teleworking and remote roles is especially confusing. It is far cheaper to promote flexible work options for military spouses than it is to pay service members more. "There were remote positions well before the pandemic," said Mika Cross, a government workplace expert who has testified before Congress on the importance of telework in maintaining a competitive federal workforce. "Those people were accurately coded and paid appropriately in remote roles, which were designed to be permanently off-site -- never requiring a government office to work in by leveraging technology to maintain productivity and connectivity." Cross said the order was confusing because it only highlighted "remote" work and not telework, and most people use the terms interchangeably, but they are different. Instead of eliminating career options for military spouses, we should be focusing on ways to codify protections, so military spouses are not forced to remind the government of their existence every time there is a change in administration. "In all the political churn and in all of the unintended consequences, you have military families suffering," Donnelly said. "We know that that's not the intent. We're just collateral damage." Military families are left to fight to be remembered. "If READINESS had passed last year, none of this would be an issue," Donnelly added. The Resilient Employment and Authorization Determination to Increase National Employment of Serving Spouses Act ( READINESS ) was a bipartisan bill that would have created federal remote and telework protections for military spouses. "It feels like the policies were written haphazardly, not to get us back to work but to force us out," said a Marine Corps spouse who works for a federal agency and asked for anonymity for fear of losing her job if she shared her concerns. She described the chilling effect the policy has already had on the community. "It's devastating and feels like a betrayal of everything we sacrifice daily." One military spouse and a Navy veteran shared her family's story of upheaval. "We're keeping our house, and I'm staying behind with the kids while he moves ahead," she said. Her spouse recently received permanent change-of-station, or PCS , orders, but due to this return-to-work directive, she was planning to live geographically separated because they could not afford for her to lose her job. "The uncertainty is unbearable, and we can't afford to move twice if I'm ordered to return to the office," she said. While some military spouse "remote" workers are theoretically "safe" from this return-to-work policy update, teleworkers are not, nor are veteran and foreign service officer spouses. And, let's be honest, nor are our civilian counterparts who serve the military community.

Title: Why GE Aerospace Stock Soared in January

For years, the aerospace business housed inside the General Electric conglomerate was considered a crown jewel. Now on its own, GE Aerospace ( GE 0.39% ) is proving its mettle. Shares of GE Aerospace gained 22% in January, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence , after the company posted a strong earnings report and provided an upbeat outlook for the year to come. A strong beat GE Aerospace is a collection of aircraft engines, interiors, and other components that became an independent company in April 2024 when General Electric completed a complex, multiyear breakup. Investors had high expectations for this business, and its fourth-quarter results did nothing to dispel that enthusiasm. GE earned $1.32 per share on sales of $10.8 billion, easily topping the consensus estimate for $1.04 per share on $9.5 billion in revenue. Earnings per share more than doubled and free cash flow was up more than 20% year over year. The outlook for 2025 was just as promising, with GE reporting orders in the quarter up 46% year over year. CEO Larry Culp forecast double-digit revenue and earnings growth and strong free cash flow in the new year, saying, "I'm confident in our ability to accelerate output and deliver for our customers." The company also announced a 30% dividend increase and said it intends to repurchase upward of $7 billion worth of shares in 2025. The results had a good impact on Wall Street, with at least a half-dozen banks raising their price target on the company. Expand NYSE : GE GE Aerospace Today's Change ( -0.39 %) $ -1.22 Current Price $ 310.72 Key Data Points Market Cap $329B Day's Range $ 307.05 - $ 312.72 52wk Range $ 159.36 - $ 316.67 Volume 2.7M Avg Vol 4M Gross Margin 37.67 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % Is GE Aerospace stock a buy? About 75% of GE Aerospace sales come from commercial aerospace, a sector that has been impacted in recent years by issues at Boeing and supply constraints that have limited production of new aircraft. Both Boeing and Airbus have multiyear backlogs of future orders. GE Aerospace should benefit as these orders get filled, but the lack of new planes also works in the company's favor. Aerospace suppliers including GE tend to get higher margins on spare part sales and should benefit as airlines are forced to keep older planes in service for longer while awaiting deliveries. This is a cyclical business and all trends point to the cycle accelerating in the years to come. Shares of GE Aerospace are up 27% in the last six months, and the ingredients are in place for this company to fly higher in the quarters to come.

By: Express Web Desk Washington | Updated: February 4, 2025 11:25 AM IST 3 min read Whatsapp twitter Facebook Reddit PRINT Migrants wearing face masks and shackles on their hands and feet sit on a military aircraft at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Tx., Thursday, Jan. 30, 2025, awaiting their deportation to Guatemala. (Photo: AP) A US military aircraft carrying Indian migrants has departed for India, marking the first deportation of its kind since President Donald Trump’s return to office, according to a US official who spoke to Reuters on Monday. The official confirmed that a C-17 military aircraft had taken off with Indian migrants on board, expected to arrive in India within 24 hours, Reuters reported. US expands military role in deportations Under Trump’s administration, the US military has been increasingly involved in immigration enforcement, deploying additional troops to the US-Mexico border, using military facilities to accommodate migrants, and employing military planes for deportations. Story continues below this ad Also read | Explained: India-US ties and the illegal immigration issue According to Reuters , previous deportation flights have sent migrants to Guatemala, Peru, and Honduras. However, this is the first time India has been included in the military deportation programme since Trump reassumed office. The Pentagon has now begun arranging flights to deport over 5,000 migrants detained in El Paso, Texas, and San Diego, California, the report added. Trump and Rubio discuss immigration with Indian leaders President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have both raised concerns over illegal immigration from India in discussions with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. Speaking about his talks with Modi, Trump stated that he expects India to “do what is right” in accepting the return of undocumented Indian migrants. Story continues below this ad The White House described the conversation between the two leaders as “productive,” highlighting discussions on ways to “expand and deepen” US-India cooperation. Meanwhile, Rubio raised the issue of “irregular immigration” with Jaishankar, who reiterated that India does not support illegal migration. “Illegal immigration is often linked to other unlawful activities. It is neither desirable nor beneficial for our reputation. If any of our citizens are found to be in the US illegally, and we verify their citizenship, we are open to their lawful return to India,” Jaishankar stated. Deportation costs and India’s response Military deportation flights are significantly more expensive than those operated by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Reuters reported that a single military deportation flight to Guatemala last week cost around $4,675 per migrant.

Estimated read time: 4-5 minutes KEY TAKEAWAYS The defense industry supported over 173,000 jobs in Utah in 2023. It contributed $22.2 billion to Utah's GDP, with Hill Air Force Base as a major hub. Federal defense jobs in Utah averaged $102,115, significantly higher than the state average. SALT LAKE CITY — At a time of relative peace and with fewer than 1% of Americans serving active duty in the military, it's easy to forget the economic impact of the defense industry — particularly in Utah. But in 2023, the defense industry directly and indirectly supported over 173,000 Utah jobs — about the size of the state's construction industry — and contributed an estimated $22.2 billion to the state's gross domestic product, according to a report released this week by the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. "Utah continues to host many national defense businesses and military installations that provide vital contributions to our national security," said Kevin Sullivan, executive director and chief operating officer of the Utah Defense Alliance Board. Such contributions cast a wide net across Utah's diverse economy, according to Levi Pace, the report's lead author and a senior economist at the University of Utah's Gardner Institute. "This industry is unique because almost 100% of its funding comes from out of state," Pace told the Deseret News. "When I think of the military and the defense industry, I'm usually thinking about active duty personnel and our National Guard service members, who carry a heavy load. But it's also a lot of civilian and contractor jobs. That's where we've seen some of the higher-paying jobs or higher growth, which supports our military preparedness and service members." The Gardner report revealed several key economic findings from fiscal year 2023: Employment — Utah's defense industry directly provided 49,540 military and civilian jobs — 2% of the state's employment. Income — Utah's federal defense workforce earned over $3.5 billion in compensation in 2023, representing 2.5% of the statewide total. Compensation for federal defense jobs in Utah averaged $102,115 — about one-third more than the state's average ($77,801) paid by all other jobs. Contracts — Of Utah's total of $5.9 billion total in defense contracts in 2023, $5.2 billion (almost 90%) went to 10 contractors — including Northrop Grumman, with $3.5 billion. Job impact — The defense industry directly and indirectly supported over 173,000 full- and part-time jobs — mostly related to Hill Air Force Base, federal support for Utah veterans, defense contracts and grants, and the Utah National Guard. GDP impact — Utah's defense industry directly or indirectly contributed an estimated $22.2 billion in GDP. That's 7.8% of the statewide total for all industries. Fiscal impacts — Defense-related activity in Utah generated net fiscal impacts of $431.3 million for the state government, based on estimated revenues of $841.5 million versus expenditures of $410.2 million. Hill AFB's deep economic reach It's difficult to overstate the primacy of Hill Air Force Base in Utah's defense industry. Stretching across Davis and Weber counties, it's the state's premier military installation in terms of budget, staffing, land area and technology, according to the report. "Hill Air Force Base has been the anchor of the defense industry in Utah for decades," said Pace. "More than half of the (state's) federal jobs in defense are at Hill AFB. "Much of the burgeoning aerospace industry — planes, missiles, drones — along with cybersecurity and communications all revolve around Hill AFB," Pace said. In 2023, Hill AFB employed 4,853 active duty military personnel, 1,067 Air Force reservists — and a whopping 14,787 federal civilian employees. That's almost 10% of the total employment in Davis County. Additionally, Hill AFB remains a major draw for government contractors. More than 6,200 employers of government contractors from the private sector worked on the base in 2023, according to the Gardner report. "We're kind of an Air Force state," said Pace. Besides Hill AFB, the Gardner report identified several other "major defense components" contributing to Utah's economy — including Dugway Proving Grounds, Tooele Army Depot, and the Utah National Guard. Meanwhile, federal support for veterans and retired defense department civilians impacts local and state economies in several ways — including Veterans Affairs health clinics and military pensions. In 2023, Utah companies, military installations and other institutions were awarded over $6 billion in federal defense contracts and grants, according to the report. Some of the top defense contractors in Utah included Northrop Grumman, L3Harris Technologies, Utah State University and Advantaged Solutions. Looking ahead: Defense and Utah's economy and jobs Federal employment in the defense sector has been "very stable" in recent years — and Pace expects that to continue. "Where I would expect to see more growth and innovation," he said, "would be in the contracting of aerospace and different kinds of technologies around our defense and military preparedness." Pace also noted that the defense industry typically boasts above-average pay. "The military is hiring people in virtually every occupation that you might see in the private sector," he said. "Many of those jobs are from advanced STEM or really creative-type jobs. So there's a lot of (job) potential for contractors and on bases, as well." × The Key Takeaways for this article were generated with the assistance of large language models and reviewed by our editorial team.

India’s socio-economic development and pathways for sustainable growth require a substantial understanding of its energy requirements. Policymakers must have access to comprehensive and reliable data on the country’s energy scenario to make better-informed decisions for India’s transition to a net-zero emissions economy by 2070. This paper offers a robust database of India’s energy landscape by validating and reconstructing the energy balance (EB) and computing emissions data. Policymakers can utilise this framework to assess the impacts of policy interventions on energy consumption and emissions in the country’s energy transition efforts. PREMIUM As a vulnerable nation, and on the back of solidarity among developing countries to win an agreement on a loss-and-damage financing mechanism, India could urge that attention to the climate crisis is not diluted. (Shutterstock) Key takeaways: · The Energy Balance (EB) is an accounting framework that maps the supply and demand of all forms of energy in a country. It provides data on energy flows in physical and common energy units for comparison. · This study identifies various gaps and inconsistencies in data on India’s energy. It reconstructs and validates these statistics by cross-referencing data from other sources, including relevant ministries, to provide a more representative picture of India’s energy landscape. For example, in this paper, the statistical differences in coal and petroleum products have been minimised by refining conversion factors. · The results of the study reveal trends in energy consumption and emissions from energy combustion. Non-coking coal, primarily used in power generation, has remained the dominant energy resource in India recently and is responsible for approximately 60% of all combustion emissions. Meanwhile, energy from renewable sources has slowly increased its share in total energy supply. · Electrification of machinery is an important step in reducing emissions. This paper presents a framework for estimating the impacts of policies on energy and emissions. It showed that electrification can lead to substantial reductions in emissions, especially when the machinery currently operates on fossil fuels with low efficiencies. A greener power grid would further help reduce emissions in the country. Data on India’s energy resources can be classified as primary or secondary in nature (i.e., if it is available naturally or requires some processing) and renewable or non-renewable. The major energy resources in India include: · Coal: This is the largest contributor to emissions from India’s energy sector. The country has abundant resources which are used for power generation, though higher-grade coking coal is imported for use in the steel industry. · Crude oil and petroleum products: India is highly dependent on crude oil imports to produce petroleum products domestically. Petroleum products contribute significantly to emissions, particularly from the transport sector. Electrification of this sector would result in lower demand for petroleum products, and hence lower import demand of crude oil. · Renewable energy sources: Solar, wind, and hydro are rapidly growing in India’s energy mix and will drive the country’s decarbonisation efforts. · Natural gas: India consumes relatively lower amounts of natural gas, though it is important for non-energy uses, such as feedstock for fertilisers and other manufacturing sectors. 1. Broader and Validated Data Collection: * Disaggregating energy consumption data by type of consumer, state, and household income levels can provide policymakers with a clearer picture of energy access and usage. * Data on biomass usage are important for a comprehensive understanding of the energy landscape in India. * India’s diverse energy landscape requires state-specific energy strategies that consider locally-available resources and consumption patterns. Policies can be tailored to help states meet their unique energy needs while contributing to national climate goals. 2. Electrification and the role of renewables: * Electrification of machinery will help reduce emissions, particularly for less-efficient sectors. * Investments in grid infrastructure and energy storage will help accommodate more renewable energy and make electrification more effective in decarbonisation. 3. Energy losses: * Large energy losses in transmission, distribution, and transformation need to be addressed, and incentives can be provided to help reduce these losses. This study underscores the critical importance of accurate and comprehensive energy statistics for understanding and modelling India’s energy landscape and transition. Through validating, disaggregating, and extending existing energy balances with data on emissions from energy combustion, this study provides a more reliable dataset for policy analysis. As India charts its path towards net-zero emissions, robust energy and emissions data will be essential for designing targeted, inclusive, and sustainable interventions that achieve the country’s long-term goals.

He made the call while setting the context for a panel discussion under the theme, "Delivering Affordable, Accessible, and Sustainable Energy Solutions for Africa" during APD 2025 Day 2 at the Accra International Conference Centre on Friday, January 31, 2025. Jinapor stressed the critical role of cooperation among African nations in overcoming the continent's energy challenges and ensuring universal access to electricity. According to him, it is crucial to address Africa’s energy deficit, because "over 600 million people on the continent still lack access to electricity." This shortage, he explained, was a significant barrier to economic growth and poverty reduction, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where energy access is most limited. "In order to achieve a sustainable energy future, Africa must work together. It is only through collaboration that we can unlock the continent’s full potential, overcome the energy crisis, and drive inclusive development," Jinapor added. The energy minister emphasized that Ghana had made strides in improving its energy infrastructure, ensuring that more of the population had access to electricity than many other nations in the region.

Jump to: The Study The Methods The Results What Does This Mean For Us? Weighted vests have recently seen a huge surge in popularity, and for good reason. Wearing a weighted vest is an easy way to pack some additional strength and conditioning gains into your walks, especially when leg day has given you some heavy DOMS. But the benefits could support our health goals even further, with new evidence showing that weighted walking could increase our energy burn by over 40%. The Study The study published in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise aimed to understand how wearing weighted vests affects energy use while walking and standing. The main purpose of the study was to develop a new model to measure energy use when wearing weighted vest since they distribute weight differently to rucksacks – which were originally studied. The Methods The study included: 20 healthy adults. Participants walking on a treadmill at different speeds while wearing weighted vests loaded with 0%, 22%, 44%, and 66% of their body weight. The researchers measured oxygen use and energy burn using a breathing mask (indirect calorimetry). The Results Carrying heavier weights reduced walking speed. As weight increased, speed decreased. The metabolic rate (calories burned per kilogram) increased as weight increased. A 22% body weight vest increased energy burn by 12.4%, 44% body weight vest increased energy burn by 25.7%, 66% body weight vest increased energy burn by 41.2%. When comparing the expenditure to rucksacks, the study confirmed that weighted vests increase energy use, but the effect is less extreme than rucksacks. For every 10% of body weight added in a rucksack, energy use increases by 19.6%. However, for every 10% of body weight added in a vest, energy use increases by 13.8%. What Does This Mean For Us? While the main purpose of this study was trialling a new testing model to measure energy expenditure, we can use the findings to support other studies available that suggest weighted walking increases energy burn. Walking with a weighted vest increases energy burn because carrying extra weight forces our muscles to work harder. The added load increases oxygen consumption and metabolic demand, making each step more energy intensive. The study found that a vest weighing 66% of body weight increased energy burn by 41.2%. However, energy burn increase depends on weight load and lighter vests have smaller effects. While weighted vests are effective, weighted rucksacks use even more energy due to the extra demand on stabilising muscles. By using a weighted vest during our walks, we could increase energy expenditure. However, it's really important to take note that with additional weight, came a reduction in walking speed , which could potentially negatively effect our energy expenditure during walks. If you have goals of using your weighted walks to increase energy output, use a weight that you can keep a brisk pace with. Start at 10% of your body weight and adjust from there.

Big update over energy bills support scheme which handed UK households £400 The think tank examined state energy bill support put in place during the energy crisis of 2022/23. News James Rodger Content Editor 16:55, 31 Jan 2025 View Image The think tank examined state energy bill support put in place during the energy crisis of 2022/23. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has slammed the government - saying the Labour Party could have saved £4.5bn by designing energy support schemes better. In its report entitled How should governments help households during an energy crisis?, the think tank examined state energy bill support put in place during the energy crisis of 2022/23. ‌ The schemes "were poorly targeted and encouraged the overuse of energy," they said. The thinktank slammed the Energy Price Guarantee, which capped average annual bills at £2,500,and the Energy Bills Support Scheme (EBSS), which saw every household receive a £400 discount on their energy bills, paid in six instalments from October 2022. ‌ Peter Levell, IFS’ deputy research director and author of the report, said: “The cost of supporting households through the energy price spike of late 2022 and early 2023 was extraordinary – £35bn over a six-month period. That is more than half the entire annual schools’ budget." ‌ READ MORE Foreign Office warns UK tourists to 'prepare' and says call 11-digit number The way that transfers were paid to households affected how they were spent. Households prepaying for their energy received the £400 energy bill rebates over Winter 2022–23 as vouchers (for traditional meters) or as automatic top-ups (for smart meters). Most households would have spent more than £400 on energy over this period in the absence of the rebates. This means the payment did not directly incentivise households to spend more on energy than if they had received the same amount as cash. Article continues below Mr Levell said: “Part of the reason for the huge cost was that the Government did not know which households had both low incomes and high energy use and so felt compelled to offer universal help. A big part of that help came in the form of a lower energy price, which itself led to higher demand, increasing the cost of the support. "Investment now in better information could save billions in the future if we ever again face a similar surge in energy prices.”

Renewable energy expansion faces hurdles: Economic Survey Survey cites energy storage technology, critical minerals as key challenges in transition to clean power sources By Avinash Nair Updated - January 31, 2025 at 07:51 PM. × Share WhatsApp X Facebook LinkedIn Messenger Reddit Mail https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/renewable-energy-expansion-faces-hurdles-economic-survey/article69164172.ece Copy Pointing out that renewable energy constitutes 47 per cent of India’s total installed capacity, the Economic Survey 2024-25 warns of substantial hurdles to further growth, particularly energy storage technologies and sourcing of critical minerals needed for the transition. The survey states that India has “negligible production capacity for key components like polysilicon, ingots, and wafers” and is dependent on imports, including from China, for its renewable energy requirements. “Despite being one of the world’s lowest greenhouse gas emitters per capita, India has made notable strides in reducing the emissions intensity of its energy consumption. This progress is largely due to the increased deployment of renewable energy sources alongside a suite of energy conservation measures. Nonetheless, the growth of renewable energy faces substantial hurdles, particularly in energy storage technologies and the sourcing of critical minerals necessary for this transition,” it states. “Lessons learned from the experiences of developed economies underscore the risks of prematurely shutting down thermal energy sources without viable technological alternatives that ensure a stable energy supply. The challenges mentioned in harnessing renewable energy at scale indicate that India will need to continue the efforts to maximise the efficiency of its existing fossil fuel resources in the medium term. The advancement and deployment of low-emission thermal power technologies, including Advanced Ultra Super Critical (AUSC) power plants, will play a pivotal role in this transition,” it added. The survey points out that India’s power sector has been bolstered primarily by large-scale solar and wind initiatives. By the end of December 2024, the country’s total renewable energy installed capacity increased by 15.8 per cent year-on-year, reaching 209.4 GW from 180.8 GW in December 2023. Renewable energy now constitutes about 47 per cent of India’s total installed capacity, highlighting a growing dependence on clean, non-fossil fuel-based energy sources. While alternative solutions such as green hydrogen present a viable option for the medium term, the economic survey states that “affordability issues” remain a significant barrier to widespread adoption. “Furthermore, although nuclear energy could contribute to India’s energy mix, its expansion is impeded by a lack of a supportive ecosystem and the monopolistic nature of nuclear fuel supply chains.” Comments More Like This Swiss technology for Avaada’s green ammonia plant in Odisha Suzlon Energy surges 5% on strong Q3 performance, manufacturing capacity boost KPI Green Energy signs ₹1,311 crore solar project deal with Coal India ACME Solar’s Q3 Results: Profit surges 152%, stock hits upper circuit two days in a row Published on January 31, 2025 READ MORE THIS AD SUPPORTS OUR JOURNALISM.

skip to content Advertisement Premium Why the Union Budget needs to provide more for energy efficiency measures Energy efficiency initiatives have delivered massive savings for India over the last two decades. A lot more needs to be done – see how the math works out with a small subsidy for energy-efficient fans Written by Pramod Kumar Singh New Delhi | Updated: January 31, 2025 07:43 PM IST 5 min read Whatsapp twitter Facebook Reddit PRINT A government subsidy of Rs 1,000 per fan for 25 million energy-efficient models would cost Rs 2,500 crore and avoid 2.2 billion units (BU) of electricity generation per year. (Wikimedia Commons) India’s progress towards energy independence and sustainable development owes much to its progress in energy efficiency. Over the past two decades, these measures have safeguarded the country’s energy security, reducing reliance on imported energy sources and optimising resource usage. In more recent years, energy efficiency has become a keystone for climate security by helping India decarbonise and edge closer to its climate goals. Energy efficiency alone has contributed to almost one-third of the country’s energy intensity (energy consumption per unit of GDP) reduction between 2005 and 2020. The stakes are even higher post-pandemic. Resource constraints due to geopolitical tensions have underscored the importance of self-reliance. Energy efficiency is no longer just about conserving resources — it is central to national security and modernising India’s energy and urban infrastructure, reducing import dependence for energy and critical minerals, and positioning the nation as a competitive force on the global stage while contributing to climate goals . Story continues below this ad What kind of savings have resulted from India’s energy efficiency initiatives? Data from the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) underscore the tremendous impact energy efficiency initiatives have had until now. Consider the following: Over 2018-2023, cumulative energy savings from national schemes have amounted to 189 million tonnes of oil equivalent (MTOE), with electricity savings alone accounting for 90 million tonnes (1 MTOE is enough to power over 3 million Indian households for a year). In the financial year 2023, energy savings from national schemes resulted in 50.8 MTOE savings with an equal share of thermal and electrical savings. In the absence of energy efficiency, India’s energy consumption in 2022-23 would have been 6.6% higher than actuals, equivalent to the energy demand of Tamil Nadu . To put the 2022-23 energy savings in perspective, the avoided thermal energy is equivalent to coal usage in 20 power plants (7% of India’s yearly coal consumption), and avoided electricity is equivalent to generation from 80 coal-fired power plants. The electricity savings in 2022-23 is equivalent to installing 200 GW solar generation capacity whereas the country has added 97 GW solar till December 2024. The economic impact of these savings is equally significant, with a reported INR 1.84 lakh crore in cost reductions during 2022-23, comparable to about 1.1% of India’s GDP. Why do these efforts need even more attention? The budgetary allocations for energy efficiency programs remain disproportionately low compared to the allocation for renewable energy. For instance, in the 2023-24 Union Budget , Rs 19,100 crore was allocated to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, while the Bureau of Energy Efficiency received only Rs 230 crore. Story continues below this ad Such a difference overlooks the undeniable fact that energy efficiency measures often yield a far higher return on investment compared to renewable energy generation alone. Also Read | The green transition India needs Consider this simple example of energy-efficient ceiling fans. Ceiling fans are commonplace yet consume substantial electricity, contributing 17.5 GW to peak electricity demand. A government subsidy of Rs 1,000 per fan for 25 million energy-efficient models would cost Rs 2,500 crore. This investment would avoid 2.2 billion units (BU) of electricity generation per year, delivering double the energy savings compared to rooftop solar installations supported through equivalent subsidy size. In addition to energy savings, energy-efficient fans significantly reduce CO2 emissions, contributing to India’s climate mitigation efforts. As policymakers seek effective energy transition strategies, combining the distribution of energy-efficient appliances with renewable energy initiatives can drive compounded energy savings and emission reductions. What is the link between energy efficiency and climate security? We also need to recognise the indispensable role energy efficiency plays in modernising India’s energy and urban systems. Story continues below this ad While renewable energy investments are necessary to expand clean energy generation, they alone cannot achieve climate security or energy independence. The annual grid emissions factor has yet to see a meaningful decline, underscoring the urgent need for complementary energy efficiency measures. Moreover, investing in energy efficiency is not merely about reducing electricity consumption – it is about unlocking systemic savings across generation, transmission, and distribution. Losses in these areas represent significant economic and environmental costs, equivalent to the output of 55 coal power plants in 2021-22. Reducing these inefficiencies through targeted investments in energy efficiency would free up financial resources that can be redirected toward healthcare, education, and renewable energy projects. Also Read | ExplainSpeaking: Are Indians being over-taxed? Here are 5 charts on where India stands globally As India seeks to solidify its position as a global leader and become developed, energy efficiency must become a national priority. Story continues below this ad The Union Budget 2025 presents an opportunity for the government to recognise energy efficiency as the first fuel in its energy transition. This recognition must be accompanied by robust investment, policy support, and direct schemes designed to tap into the vast potential of energy efficiency measures. By doing so, India can achieve a clean, resilient, and competitive energy future. Prioritising energy efficiency will not only strengthen the nation’s energy security and climate resilience but also ensure that its economic ambitions are realised sustainably and inclusively.

TIL Creatives Representational AI image. India’s green energy transition is being shaped by both domestic objectives and the evolving global trade landscape, as outlined in the Economic Survey 2024. The Survey stressed India’s commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2070, yet it noted the challenges in ensuring a smooth shift to renewable energy amid shifting global trade relations and policies. The report, prepared under the guidance of the Chief Economic Advisor to the Finance Ministry, cautions that trade conflicts between major economies—China, the United States, the European Union, and other G7 nations—could disrupt the supply and cost of crucial green technologies. Read Also | India needs 8% growth for two decades to achieve 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047, says Economic Survey 2024 Such disruptions could hinder global efforts to reduce emissions and could have significant repercussions for countries like India, which rely on imported clean energy technologies to meet their renewable energy targets. India's energy transition is closely tied to global trends, meaning that any tensions in international markets could not only delay but also escalate the cost of India’s green shift. These major economies, which collectively account for over 50% of global greenhouse gas emissions, have committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. They are also highly interdependent in the trade of critical environmental goods and technologies, such as solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicles. Live Events "China, the United States, the EU, and other G7 economies produce more than 50 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. All have target dates of 2050 to reach net-zero emissions. These economies depend heavily on each other in the trade of environmental goods and technologies central to developing renewable energy and reducing emissions. Hence, trade conflicts between these economies will pose significant risks to the green energy transition, imposing huge costs on the global economy," read the report. China's role in global energy transition As the world's largest producer and consumer of renewable energy technologies, China plays a central role in the global green transition, said the report. For India, the pathway to energy transition runs through China, which dominates the production of solar panels, batteries, and other essential green technologies. India’s green energy goals are thus closely tied to China’s production capabilities and trade policies. "As the world navigates the challenges of climate change, the road to energy transition runs through China," the report further read. Read Also | AI in Banking: Revolution or risk? Economic Survey 2024 warns of the fine line ahead While India has made significant strides in domestic renewable energy production, its reliance on imports from China for key components presents both opportunities and risks. The path ahead for India’s green transition Despite these challenges, India remains resolute in its commitment to combat climate change. The Panchamrit framework – which includes reducing the carbon intensity of its economy, increasing the share of non-fossil energy capacity, and achieving a net-zero target by 2070 – will guide the country’s green energy policies over the next few decades. The government’s focus on scaling renewable energy projects, promoting energy efficiency, and enhancing sustainability will remain pivotal as India navigates its energy transition. However, as the Economic Survey points out, the path to a green future is littered with global uncertainties. As trade conflicts and political challenges continue to affect global energy markets, India’s ability to meet its climate targets will depend not only on domestic policy and investment but also on how the global green energy landscape evolves.

Auto Components 5 min read How budget can recharge Indian renewable industry’s battery The 2025 Union Budget of India presents a pivotal opportunity to boost the renewable energy sector by focusing on critical infrastructure like energy storage systems and domestic battery manufacturing. Strategic investments, policy support, and green financial mechanisms could drive significant advancements towards India's renewable energy goals. Kavinder Khurana ET CONTRIBUTORS Updated On Jan 30, 2025 at 03:15 PM IST Copy Link Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on X Share on Telegram Share on Facebook But still, the high price for it and the nonexistence of a well-established supply chain in the country have inhibited its widespread use. The 2025 Union Budget of India marks an essential juncture in India's quest for a green future. Global energy dynamics are experiencing dramatic changes, offering India's renewable energy sector an incredible opportunity to help combat climate change while simultaneously increasing energy independence. But its success hinges on strategic investments, policy support and creating an ecosystem to facilitate clean energy technologies. The 2025 Budget presents India with an unparalleled opportunity to give renewable energy an extra push. At its core will be providing critical infrastructure like energy storage systems that unlock intermittent renewable sources like solar and wind power. By incentivizing domestic battery manufacturing , supporting innovative storage solutions, and expanding financial mechanisms, India could unleash a sustainable yet economically robust green revolution. Advt India's renewable energy capacity is on a mounting trajectory. One of its remaining challenges to fulfillment, though, is the move from intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar to completely storage-based energy, which requires robust technology, while one of its ambitious projections of hitting 500 gigawatts from BESS-sourced wind and solar energy by the year 2030 will need it as a source. A BESS System, or energy storage battery, saves energy generated when the power requirement for the generation of energy is high and releases it when generation is lower and demand is higher. This great compression technology even works with substances like wind and solar to make up for their non-constant nature, which is a major setback. But still, the high price for it and the nonexistence of a well-established supply chain in the country have inhibited its widespread use. Budget 2025 : An opportunity for energy storage and battery manufacturing The 2025 Budget presents an unprecedented opportunity to tackle these challenges head-on by creating policies that encourage energy storage solutions to grow and drive innovation in this sector. India needs an ecosystem for green finance that will fuel the development of Battery Energy storage system by providing reduced financing costs and clear long-term incentives, which in turn could fuel its transition towards renewables. Government incentives could take the form of subsidies or tax breaks for investments in Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), which are currently costly to deploy. Such incentives could significantly lower upfront costs for businesses, utilities, and consumers when adopting BESS across the country. An increase in demand would also encourage private investments, further driving innovation and competition within the storage market. Advt India has a unique opportunity to position itself as a manufacturing hub for lead-acid batteries, which remain a cornerstone of energy storage systems in various applications. While the focus has often been on advanced technologies, lead-acid batteries offer a cost-effective and reliable solution for energy storage. By offering fiscal incentives such as tax rebates or concessional financing to domestic lead-acid battery manufacturers, the 2025 Budget can bolster local production, reduce dependency on imports, create jobs, and expand India’s technological capabilities in this field. Battery as a Service (BaaS): An emerging energy storage model One novel concept that could transform India's energy storage landscape is Battery as a Service (BaaS). Under this model, consumers rent batteries instead of owning them outright for renewable energy storage applications or other uses. This eliminates upfront costs while shifting maintenance, replacement, and upgrade burdens to service providers. For BaaS to gain momentum, governments must incentivize its adoption through targeted subsidies and tax breaks. Furthermore, policy frameworks must support the establishment of a robust BaaS infrastructure throughout the nation, including storage hubs and battery-swapping facilities. BaaS could serve as a game-changer for millions of consumers across both urban and rural settings, encouraging greater adoption of decentralized energy storage solutions. By eliminating financial barriers to the ownership of batteries, it aligns with India’s renewable energy ambitions while also creating new business opportunities for service providers. Addressing prohibitive GST on batteries and BESS One critical issue hindering the large-scale adoption of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) in India is the 28per cent GST levied on batteries and BESS. This highest slab of GST significantly increases the cost of these essential products, making them prohibitive for widespread adoption. The government should consider reducing this GST rate in the 2025 Budget to make batteries and BESS more affordable. A lower GST rate could encourage large-scale adoption, drive innovation, and help align India’s clean energy goals with economic viability. Green finance and global partnerships: A path forward The Indian government has already made great strides toward encouraging green investments through initiatives like issuing green bonds aimed at financing projects with environmental benefits. However, further work needs to be done on green finance in energy storage and battery manufacturing environments, particularly with regard to battery manufacturing capacity expansion. The 2025 Budget may offer an important opportunity to boost green bonds, green banks, and other innovative financial instruments that would channel private capital towards renewable energy infrastructure development. India can benefit substantially from collaborating with global players in the renewable energy and battery manufacturing sectors. As demand for clean energy solutions rises globally, India offers enormous potential for international partnerships in these fields. India should create an environment conducive to such collaborations in its 2025 Budget by streamlining regulatory processes, offering stable policy support, and offering incentives for joint ventures in battery manufacturing or renewable energy storage projects. India should adopt elements to facilitate its transition towards cleaner and more sustainable energy production and consumption; additionally, these components would position India as a global leader in renewable energy innovation and production. Innovation-powered green future India's 2025 Union Budget holds great promise to be a game-changer for its renewable energy sector. By addressing critical storage issues, incentivizing domestic battery manufacturing, and supporting innovative business models like BaaS, this Budget could accelerate India's transition towards a greener and more sustainable future. In conclusion, now is the time for industrialists, policymakers, and global leaders to shape this transformation with strategic investments, policy incentives, and technological breakthroughs that combine to meet India's ambitious renewable energy targets while becoming global powerhouses within this sector.

Published on Africa Can End Poverty Unleashing opportunities for women in Africa with access to energy Nathalie Kouassi Akon January 28, 2025 This page in: English English English Woman in village thrilled to get a Sun King Pro solar lantern that provides affordable energy access through PAYG (pay-as-you-go) and charges mobile phones. Photo: Sun King The extraordinary lack of energy in Africa–affecting about 300 million women-has profound effects on women’s economic opportunities. Women are already disproportionately affected by energy poverty, especially in rural areas. On average, women and girls spend 50 hours a week just fetching firewood, cooking, and collecting water. That’s 50 hours spent on subsistence, not on growing a business, pursuing education, or improving their health. In fact, 900 million African women and girls who lack access to clean cooking technology suffer from smoke inhalation-related diseases. That’s a huge barrier to their health, education, and economic potential. Now, imagine a world where women have access to reliable electricity, clean cooking, and safe water. Not only would their quality of life improve, but their economic opportunities would expand. Women in rural areas are more likely to become wage-earners when they have access to electricity. They can run businesses, engage in entrepreneurial ventures, and contribute to their economies in ways that were previously impossible. More women would own or lead small and medium sized enterprises (SME), creating jobs and stimulating growth in their countries. We can't ignore the fact that energy access is also directly tied to gender-based violence (GBV). About 44% of African women have experienced GBV, and the lack of energy only exacerbates this issue. Power outages, for example, contribute to the insecurity and vulnerability that many women face. The lack of energy also impedes women’s access to financial services, limiting their ability to support and empower themselves, and grow their businesses. Simply put, energy access is an essential tool in the fight for women’s rights and economic empowerment . This is where the of the World Bank Group (WBG)’s three institutions IBRD, IFC, and MIGA, come in. Mission 300 aims to connect 300 million Africans to electricity by 2030 through both grid connections and renewable energy solutions. We will make huge strides with projects such as the Nigeria Distributed Access through Renewable Energy Scale-up (DARES), Accelerating Sustainable and Clean Energy Access Transformation (ASCENT) , Acumen’s Hardest to Reach Initiative, and Release by Scatec , which will bring power to 250 million people. The African Development Bank is also joining the effort, helping another 50 million people gain access to energy. It’s clear that energy access is a game changer for women. When women have reliable access to energy, their ability to educate their children, run businesses, and improve their own health and safety skyrockets. It creates a ripple effect that benefits entire communities. Clean energy access is tied to everything from improved health and education to better wages and less GBV. But the key is ensuring that energy solutions are affordable, accessible, and meet the specific needs of women. This is where governments, organizations, and businesses need to step up. We need to prioritize women’s needs in the energy sector from clean cooking, to water access, to safety. It’s time to unlock the full economic potential of women by giving them the tools they need to succeed. If we want to unleash Africa's full potential, we can’t afford to leave women behind. So, let’s move from the dream to reality and keep pushing to connect more people with affordable, sustainable energy and clean cooking. As energy access expands, the future is bright, especially for women.

EDP Renewables North America Yahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article. This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) published a white paper outlining the industry group's vision for U.S. energy storage, setting a target to install 10 million distributed energy storage sites and reach 700 kWh of installed storage capacity the end of the decade. The white paper, released Jan. 28 along with a guide to energy storage regulatory policies in each of the 50 states, discusses policy recommendations that would open markets for development of energy storage. The paper, which can be accessed here , also looks at ways to obtain financial support for storage, build a U.S. storage supply chain, and support the continuing push for long-duration storage technology. “Expanding energy storage capacity is a crucial means of ensuring our nation’s energy security and resilience,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “As demand for energy soars, storage helps turn quick-to-build, low-cost solar generation into clean, dispatchable power, ensuring our grid can adapt to challenges, support critical infrastructure, and deliver reliable power to every community.” Connect with POWER at the InterSolar & Energy Storage North America conference in San Diego, California, Feb. 25-27, 2025. Read more of POWER's coverage of energy storage here , and make plans now to attend Experience POWER , our long-running flagship event, scheduled for Oct. 29-31, 2025, in Denver, Colorado. Data from Wood Mackenzie shows there currently is 83 GWh of installed energy storage capacity in the U.S. The group also said there are nearly 500,000 distributed storage installations. SEIA on its website states, “Solar and storage are a dynamic pair, and together will form the backbone of a clean, reliable electricity system. Storage is critical to our nation’s climate stability, energy resilience and abundance, and to a smoothly operating grid.” Jason Kaminsky, CEO of kWh Analytics , a renewable energy risk assessment group, told POWER that solar paired with energy storage will be the primary source of long-term growth to meet increasing energy demand. “Despite an expected near-term increase in natural gas, solar and storage will continue to be the primary source of long-term growth to meet increasing energy demand spurred on by economic growth, crypto and AI,” said Kaminsky. The executive also said that resilient supply chains will enable solar to manage industry cost structure, even in the face of new or stronger tariffs from the Trump administration. “Solar and storage growth are unlikely to be excessively disadvantaged by new or strengthened tariffs. Years of prior tariffs and restrictions have made solar supply chains resilient and dynamic, historically enabling the industry to manage cost structure,” said Kaminsky. 'Positive' About Solar and Storage Eric Packer, senior vice president of Strategic Initiatives at Rexel USA , a major U.S. electrical distribution company, recently told POWER his company remains positive about solar energy paired with energy storage. “Our outlook remains positive for PV and energy storage systems. Stored solar energy enables the allocation of energy on demand instead of only being able to have energy when the sun is up, which has been a limiting factor,” said Packer. “We continue to see interest and investments in microgrids, which harness solar energy and reapply it back to the grid at peak demand times or as needed from demand.” Current industry forecasts show that U.S. storage capacity is expected to reach 450 GWh by 2030, though analysts have said that is not enough to support the need for storage, which often is used to help balance the intermittency of renewable energy resources such as solar and wind power. The SEIA is asking states, regional transmission organizations, and the federal government to pursue accelerated deployment of energy storage, and more manufacturing of equipment to serve the sectors. The actions include: Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Preserving the federal tax credit for standalone storage. Ensuring equal grid access and fair compensation to storage for grid services. Reforming interconnection processes to account for storage flexibility. Establishing affordable retail rates for storage charging. Supporting domestic manufacturing with targeted trade policies and streamlined permitting. Implementing state-level procurement programs. Emphasizing investments in low-income communities, including areas disproportionately impacted by extreme weather and poor air quality. Investing in further development of long-duration storage. “The U.S. storage market is at an inflection point, but with the mix of policy support and private, state and federal collaboration, we can achieve SEIA’s storage targets while creating jobs and ensuring reliable, around the clock power for every home and business in this county,” said Joan White, SEIA’s director of storage and interconnection. Andrew Tang, vice president, Energy Storage and Optimization for Wärtsilä Energy , recently addressed the landscape for energy storage. Tang told POWER : “In an effort to reach these goals, [e.g. ambitious climate targets from COP29 and the rapid expansion of AI infrastructure], energy storage projects will continue to grow in size and scope. The size of energy storage projects has been steadily increasing to the multi-gigawatt-hour scale and will continue to do so next year.” Tang continued, “Energy storage systems will continue to be increasingly geared towards energy shifting, driven by the ever-growing penetration of intermittent renewable energy generation and the concomitant need to store energy for dispatch in times when supply and demand are mismatched. At the same time, dedicated renewables firming requirements are popping up in a diversity of markets globally. As these projects move closer to population centers, addressing challenges like noise mitigation and fire safety will become even more critical. “The growth of energy storage will continue alongside the drive for renewable energy expansion. We’ll see the supply chain evolve in 2025, with the industry moving toward further diversifying manufacturing resources to ensure that supply meets both customer cost and market requirements,” said Tang. — Darrell Proctor is a senior editor for POWER.

What The Side Of The Bed You Sleep On Says About Your Energy Did you know there's a side of the bed for masculine and feminine energy? Mary-Faith Martinez Written on Jan 29, 2025 Nenad Aksic | Shutterstock Advertisement Whether you share a bed with a significant other or not, everyone has a preferred side when it comes to a good night's rest. Think about walking into a hotel room — there's always a bedside you are immediately drawn to. Why is that? Have you ever wondered if the side of the bed you sleep on holds any significance to you as a person? Well, according to feng shui practitioners, it certainly does. Believe it or not, it actually determines whether you have more masculine or feminine energy. Advertisement The side of the bed you sleep on affects the kind of energy you have. A woman named Elle shared some things she had recently learned about feng shui that helped her understand what sleeping on each side of the bed means for your energy. “It was talking about [how] one side of your body is the feminine and one side of your body is the masculine, right?” she said of the video she watched. “And how specifically the side that you sleep on impacts the energy that you are embodying, and the energy that you are leaving space to receive, right, um, or to enter your life in some way.” AtnoYdur | Canva Pro Advertisement “Which I feel like makes sense, right?” she continued. “You’re sitting in that energy while you’re sleeping for anywhere, like, from roughly eight hours a day.” Elle said that, if you wanted, you could also use this information to change or retrain your energy.“If that’s something that you’re trying to, like, train yourself to be in, it’s very fascinating,” she said. Elle also said this has proven true in her own life. “I was, like, reflecting … back to my relationships, and I’m like, ‘Oh my goodness,’” she shared. “I’m not kidding. My side of the bed switched in almost every single one of my relationships when I, like, started becoming more masculine in the relationship, and I started sleeping on the masculine side of the bed.” She added, “And currently, I sleep on the masculine side of the bed as a single mom who very regularly needs to embody my masculine energy .” RELATED: 3 Habits Happy People With Deep, Meaningful Relationships Have Mastered, According to a Mindset Coach Advertisement Which sides of the bed hold masculine and feminine energy? After discussing the basics of this energy phenomenon, Elle addressed the real question in everyone’s minds i n a follow-up video . “If you are walking into a room, you’re looking at your bed, so you’re at the foot of your bed,” she described. “If you sleep on the left side of the bed, then you’re embodying your feminine energy, where if you sleep on the right side of the bed, you’re embodying your masculine energy.” Elle explained that this comes from the idea that there are masculine and feminine energy sides of the body. “And that goes for your physical body as well, right?” she continued. “Um, your physical body, everything on the left side of your body is your feminine energy, and everything on your right side of the body is your masculine energy.” As an example, Elle used pain in the left hip, which she said could be indicative of a mother wound. “It’s almost like, I think that when you’re ready to deal with something, your body and your mind unlock it for you, right? Uh, they start giving you breadcrumbs so that you consciously can deal with something your subconscious has been holding onto,” she concluded. Advertisement RELATED: 10 Ways To Activate & Tap Into Your Dark Feminine Energy The concept of masculine and feminine energies, each taking up one side of the body, is connected to the idea of yin and yang. According to Australia’s Kevala Health , “The Yin energy is feminine, and the Yang is masculine. We are made up of both feminine and masculine energy. These two very different energies complement each other.” More for You: Taylor Swift's Former Classmate Explains Why 'People Hated Her' In High School How To Spot A REAL Narcissist (And Not Just A Bad Person) Boss Uses ‘Wobbly Chair Test’ In Every Interview And Avoids Hiring Job Candidates That Fail People Born On These 6 Days Of Any Month Are Destined For Financial Success Kevala Health confirmed that the left side of your body correlates to feminine energy and the right side to masculine energy. As Elle said, this is also true of the sides of the bed.

Title: Donald Trump , Accidental Climate Savior ?

Article Content:
... By Jesus Mesa Politics Reporter Share Newsweek is a Trust Project member President Donald Trump 's latest energy-related executive orders, widely criticized by environmentalists, may unexpectedly support efforts to combat climate change, an issue he has previously denied. Issued during the first week of his second term, the orders aim to deregulate fossil fuel production, streamline permitting and roll back key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), spurring intense debate. But the measures may inadvertently boost climate action by addressing inefficiencies in renewable energy deployment and encouraging advanced nuclear power, according to an expert. Why It Matters The executive order, titled "Unleashing American Energy," directs federal agencies to "suspend, revise, or rescind all agency actions identified as unduly burdensome" to domestic energy production. During the campaign, Trump advocated for an energy policy focused on fossil fuels, emphasizing infrastructure like roads, bridges and combustion-engine vehicles. "Drill, baby, drill!" was a frequent rallying cry. ... These actions, along with the rollback of subsidies for wind and solar power, underscore Trump's skepticism of environmental policies and his disdain for renewable energy, criticizing Biden-era investments aimed at reducing U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. What To Know While often portrayed as a boost to the fossil fuel industry, some argue that recent measures under Trump's administration could also streamline the development of clean energy technologies, particularly nuclear power. "This seems like a simple story of a callous administration gleefully wrecking the environment to benefit its fossil fuel backers," Quico Toro, contributing editor for Persuasion , wrote in a recent analysis. "But it's not so simple. By killing their worst ideas, [Trump's administration] has just done the climate movement a big favor." Toro argues that overreliance on weather-dependent renewable energy sources like wind and solar has led to grid instability and rising energy prices. Removing regulatory barriers to nuclear development, he adds, could pave the way for more sustainable and politically viable decarbonization strategies. A Mixed Reception Among Environmentalists Environmental advocates have sharply criticized Trump's actions, viewing them as a rollback of the climate-friendly policies implemented under former President Joe Biden . The rollback of IRA and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funding disbursements, combined with the exclusion of wind and solar from the administration's definition of "domestic energy," signals a deliberate de-emphasis on renewables. Additionally, according to a Harvard Environmental Law Program analysis of the executive order, the administration's declaration of a national energy emergency has been challenged as unnecessary, given the record-high levels of oil and natural gas production in recent years. "In 2023, the U.S. produced an average of 12.9 million barrels of crude oil per day, the highest in history, and exported 11.9 billion cubic feet of LNG [liquefied natural gas] daily," it says. But analysts like Toro see potential benefits in Trump's push for deregulation, particularly for nuclear energy. New orders aimed at streamlining permitting processes under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) could benefit large-scale infrastructure projects, including advanced nuclear plants. ... "NEPA has become a NIMBY's best friend, creating a labyrinthine permitting process that lets anti-development groups delay projects they don't like," Toro wrote. By cutting red tape, the administration could accelerate the deployment of next-generation nuclear reactors, which provide reliable, zero-emission energy. Chris Wright, Trump's energy secretary, expressed optimism about nuclear power's role in America's energy future. "We're committed to bringing advanced nuclear technology to market," Wright said during a press briefing. "This administration understands that energy abundance and environmental responsibility can coexist." Addressing Renewable Energy's Limitations A central focus of Trump's energy agenda is addressing the shortcomings of renewable energy, particularly its intermittency. Wind and solar power rely on weather conditions, leading to grid instability and higher costs when paired with insufficient energy storage solutions. "If this administration seriously pursues licensing fourth-generation nuclear plant designs, Trump could—paradoxically—be remembered for ending the fossil fuel economy," Toro wrote in Persuasion . Despite these potential upsides, critics remain skeptical. "It's clear this administration prioritizes fossil fuel development above all else," said environmental policy expert Emily Rodriguez in an interview with PBS . "While nuclear power is part of the equation, the broader push to expand oil and gas production undermines renewable energy efforts." What People Are Saying Jason Ryan, spokesperson for the American Clean Power Association, told the Associated Press : "Energy dominance requires a true 'all of the above' energy approach that unleashes our nation's diverse resources to meet surging demand." Trump, in his inauguration address: "We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top, and export American energy all over the world." Wright, Trump's energy secretary and also founder of Liberty Energy: "Our aim is to boost natural gas and nuclear energy, moving away from the previous administration's clean energy priorities." What Happens Next The long-term impact of Trump's energy policies will depend on implementation and market dynamics. Experts like Toro argue that shifting focus to nuclear power could help the U.S. achieve its climate goals more effectively than a singular reliance on wind and solar.

Business Automotive Economy Energy Finance Tourism Tech Defense Transportation News Analysis Türkiye's solar capacity doubles in 2.5 years to surpass 2025 target by Daily Sabah ISTANBUL Jan 28, 2025 - 2:35 pm GMT+3 A solar power plant is seen in Bayburt province, northeastern Türkiye, Jan. 8, 2025. (AA Photo) by Daily Sabah Jan 28, 2025 2:35 pm Türkiye has doubled its solar energy capacity over the past two-and-a-half years to surpass its 2025 target ahead of schedule, signaling the nation’s potential for more ambitious future goals, a report said Tuesday. By the end of 2024, Türkiye’s solar energy capacity exceeded 19 gigawatts (GW), doubling from 9.7 GW in July 2022, London-based energy think tank Ember said. By August last year, the country had already surpassed the 18 GW target set for 2025 in the National Energy Plan (NEP) by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources. “Achieving this target one and a half years ahead of schedule underscores Türkiye’s strong commitment to solar energy and signals the need for more ambitious future targets,” Ember said. The previous doubling of solar energy capacity required more than four years between 2018 and 2022, it noted. The rapid expansion was driven primarily by self-consumption solar installations, which accounted for 94% of new projects since July 2022. To advance the momentum, Ember said Türkiye could utilize rooftop, hybrid, floating and storage-integrated solar potential, which it says collectively represent a vast untapped potential. Ember says Türkiye has a pipeline of 33 GW in pre-licensed storage-integrated solar and wind projects, far exceeding the official 2030 target of 2.1 GW. “With these capacities, the country is well-positioned to sustain its renewable energy growth trajectory,” the think tank says. New opportunities The Renewable Energy Resource Zone (YEKA) model remains pivotal to Türkiye’s solar and wind expansion. The scheme was introduced in 2016 to facilitate land allocation for investors, ease the deployment of large projects and encourage the domestic production of renewable energy technologies. Under the YEKA scope, 3 GW of solar energy tenders have been conducted over eight years, resulting in 1.5 GW of capacity being commissioned, while 630 MW of projects were canceled. The government unveiled updates to the YEKA model in 2024 to draw greater investor interest. Key enhancements include simplifying post-tender permitting procedures and introducing financial incentives like exemptions from transmission fees. Furthermore, the planned 800 MW solar power plant tender for 2025 has increased the total capacity of the YEKA solar power plants project portfolio to 3.8 GW. According to the Energy and Natural Resources Ministry’s Renewable Energy 2035 Road Map, Türkiye aims to conduct at least 2 GW of wind and solar tenders annually. The Ember report also highlighted the potential for 53 GW of floating solar power plants, which could utilize underused water surfaces and significantly increase renewable capacity through YEKA auctions. “With hybrid plants, YEKA projects and the 24 GW of self-consumption-focused solar power plants currently under development, solar energy capacity could increase two and a half times by the end of this decade, surpassing 55 GW,” it noted. Battery storage also represents a growing opportunity, according to Ember. By the end of 2024, Türkiye had granted pre-licenses for 14 GW of solar projects with integrated storage, pointing to the potential for enhanced energy security and grid stability. That figure far exceeds the 2.1 GW storage capacity target set in the NEP for 2030. Renewables save $15 billion Over the past two-and-a-half years, solar and wind energy have saved Türkiye $15 billion, which would have otherwise been paid for natural gas imports, Ember said. “This underscores that raising renewable capacity targets not only strengthens Türkiye’s energy independence but also amplifies its economic benefits,” it added. Solar energy alone accounted for 6% of the country’s electricity supply, generating 52 terawatt-hours (TWh) over the past two and a half years. “This avoided $5.4 billion in natural gas imports over the same period,” the report said. Türkiye unveiled its National Energy Plan in 2023, establishing renewable energy and sustainability targets for 2025, 2030, and 2035. However, during COP29 in November 2024, the Environment, Urbanization, and Climate Change Ministry presented the Long-Term Climate Change Strategy (LTS) that included updates to 2030 and 2035 benchmarks. The solar capacity target for 2035 was revised under the LTS to 77 GW, an ambitious 45% increase from the NEP’s initial goal of 53 GW. Bahadır Sercan Gümüş, energy analyst at Ember, emphasized that the consistent growth in solar capacity demonstrates Türkiye’s potential for more ambitious renewable energy targets. “By doubling its solar energy capacity in just two and a half years and surpassing its 2025 target ahead of schedule, Türkiye has demonstrated its potential to set more ambitious goals, Gümüş said. “Raising renewable energy targets and maintaining the momentum offers Türkiye the opportunity to reduce its dependence on energy imports, strengthen energy security, and assert its commitment more prominently on the international stage.” shortlink copied KEYWORDS renewable energy energy power solar energy solar power plant türkiye The Daily Sabah Newsletter Keep up to date with what’s happening in Turkey, it’s region and the world.

Generate Key Takeaways The Capitol in Salt Lake City is pictured on Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch) Can Utah become the energy capital of the country? The Legislature is willing to explore that, aiming to become pioneers in nuclear energy developments, creating a set of governing bodies that are expected to oversee energy development zones and, overall, setting a foundation for the future of nuclear power in Utah. HB249 , or Nuclear Power Amendments, a big bill sponsored by Rep. Carl Albretch, R-Richfield, creates the Nuclear Energy Consortium and the Utah Energy Council, which would lead the way to designate energy development zones throughout the state. The House Public Utilities and Energy Committee voted unanimously to recommend the bill for the full House’s consideration. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement It may take awhile before nuclear energy is powering electricity-hungry data centers across the state. But, Albrecht said on Monday, this is a starter for the nuclear industry in the state — and other resources in Utah’s energy mix. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX “Anybody that knows anything about energy will tell you that unless the new administration on the federal level loosens up regulation for nuclear, we’re still 10, 12-plus years down the road to have a fully operating nuclear plant in the state of Utah,” he said. “However, there are SMRs that have been developed, small modular reactors. They can be put on the back of a truck as big as this room and placed somewhere.” In line with Republican leadership’s main goals for this legislative session to allow the construction of small nuclear reactors in Utah, the council would oversee site identification — including state lands — permitting, financial plans for the projects, and other strategies for energy development. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement During the committee hearing Albrecht praised nuclear power as being clean and plentiful. And while most data centers have expressed a desire to have “green-washed” power, as he described it, meaning mostly wind and solar, those resources are intermittent. “I think we need to be on the cutting edge in the state of Utah, as we are on a lot of things, and start down this nuclear path,” he said. But, some Utahns, looking at a long history of nuclear disasters, remained skeptical of the state’s plans. A new Utah Energy Council The bill has 25 pages, which Albrecht said is oddly long for him. However, there are many moving parts in it. The Utah Energy Council, for example, will have appointees from legislative leadership, the governor’s office and the Office of Energy Development. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement With this bill, the state is also expected to work alongside counties, cities and towns in the process of establishing “energy development zones.” These areas will only go to the municipalities that want and approve them, Albrecht said, and will be evaluated according to their suitability in hosting energy infrastructure projects, which includes factors such as access to energy resources and proximity to existing transmission lines. Nuclear development and electricity rates to dominate energy discussion this legislative session The legislation calls for public incentives restrictions to avoid “pitting one county against the other in a bidding process.” Tax increment from the energy zones will be allocated to the Energy Development Investment Fund for the council to administer for energy infrastructure development. But, the council is required to consult with municipalities to determine a tax sharing plan. The fund can also be used to match funds from federal grants, Albrecht said, which lawmakers are already counting on. “If the Trump administration decides we’re going to move forward on energy and ‘drill, baby, drill,’ then there probably will be some federal energy grants,” he said. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement If the bill passes, there would also be an energy research boost, since Utah would also form a research board with representatives from The University of Utah, Utah State University, the Commissioner of Higher Education, and the Idaho National Laboratory, among others. In a state full of downwinders, safety concerns linger The committee’s public comment period saw a mix of approval and concern over the unintended consequences of hosting a nuclear reactor. The bill has the support of the executive branch, some officials said on Monday. It’s building momentum and advancing on past state efforts, such as the San Rafael Energy Lab, Joel Ferry, executive director of the Utah Department of Natural Resources, told the committee. But, the bill was also presented during the National Day of Remembrance for American Downwinders, which commemorates those who died from cancer or other diseases caused by nuclear radiation exposure from U.S. weapons testing, a big reminder of what could go wrong if the resources are mishandled. Sen. Hawley blasts rumors of expanding payments for Utah downwinders only “The government representatives had so much enthusiasm for the very legitimate positive benefits of nuclear that they failed to grasp and account for the very severe dangers associated with it,” Mike Maxwell, who identified himself as a former employee of a nuclear power producer, said. “Nuclear energy is powerful; it can also be incredibly dangerous to all the living things on this planet.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Maxwell asked lawmakers to keep working on the bill, since it lacks an oversight process for health and environmental issues in the application of energy zones. Ava Curtis, who’s pursuing a career in environmental studies, said that while she understands the need to opt for low-carbon energy sources, her family’s health history is a constant reminder of why she believes nuclear isn’t the way to go. “My mom worked at the uranium labs. She used to look out the window of her office to see the river below her office glowing, something her boss told her happens all the time and with no cause for concern,” she said. “Cancer and genetic disorders are incredibly high in the community, including in my own family.” She urged that those who have been the most impacted by nuclear energy have a voice in the energy council, including indigenous communities that have been at the center of the uranium industry. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Albrecht, however, defended his bill, arguing that nuclear electricity generation is different from what caused those health problems throughout history. “Our cemeteries are full of people who were affected by the downwind, but that was the government lying to us, as somebody said, and that was caused by above-ground test blasts,” he said. “It was not caused by the generation of electric power.” The technology keeps improving, Albrecht said, getting to a point where it’s safer and waste could be processed again. The bill is still a work in progress and “probably does need some work on health and safety,” but it’s a start, he said. Now, how much will it cost? Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “There’ll be some great shock,” Albrecht said about the price. “ But this will not be a plant tomorrow or the next day or the next year. This plant generation is going to be 10, 15 years down the road, and hopefully technology improves and we regenerate power with zero carbon.” SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE About Our Ads

And environmental and sustainability benefits are on tap Summarise Share Energy-transition assets are part of the growing infrastructure market, where new capital is likely to be constantly required over the next 20 to 30 years. PHOTO: PIXABAY Minal Patel Published Tue, Jan 28, 2025 · 04:50 PM FOR more than 200 years, the global economy was dependent on fossil fuels for its energy needs. This is rapidly changing. Renewable energy, driven by the so-called “power trio” of decarbonisation, affordability and energy security, is becoming a critical factor in meeting future power needs. The global energy transition thus represents a potentially unparalleled and attractive investment opportunity. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that around US$4.5 trillion needs to be invested each year into the energy transition from the early 2030s, an almost three-fold increase from 2023, itself a record year. This investment is on a global basis, with almost universal support for evolving a decarbonised, cheap and secure energy system. Even in the US and despite a shifting political climate, there has been broad, widespread and largely bipartisan support for renewables investment over a number of years, given that the sector is a key engine for job creation and that it increasingly delivers energy cost-competitiveness. Despite this, a question we often get asked is: Why invest solely in the energy transition? The assumption inherent to the question is that an investment into a wider infrastructure mandate – including exposure to energy-transition assets, as well as other sectors such as utilities, transport and digital infrastructure – could offer a broader opportunity set. Given that investors’ capacity to allocate to alternative assets is finite (on average representing around 14 per cent of portfolios according to Schroders research), and is therefore a scarce resource, the value of which must be utilised to its full potential, we believe maximising investment in energy transition is crucial for a high-performing portfolio, for three key reasons. Highly differentiated The first reason is that energy-transition allocations are highly differentiated, relative to other investments you hold in your portfolio. A historical analysis of annualised returns and risk (volatility) between 2014 and 2024 shows that the overall, long-term risk-and-return characteristics of energy-transition infrastructure largely align with those of broader infrastructure portfolios. This in itself is an interesting observation, contradicting the widely held belief that diversified infrastructure portfolios must be less risky due to their diversified nature. The analysis is also limited by assessing aggregate risk and return independently. It doesn’t capture the dynamics of specific, underlying risk exposures within energy transition infrastructure and how these can translate to long-term return potential. Intuitively, the risks associated with energy-transition infrastructure are highly diversifying, exposing investors to a unique mix of risk premia, compared to non-energy infrastructure sub-sectors and other asset classes. Here are some sources of risk: SEE ALSO Sustainable corporate bonds: rising demand amid tight supply The inauguration of a new chapter in sustainable investing Inflation risk: Returns are typically linked to inflation, helping to maintain the real purchasing power of a portfolio. Positive power price risk: Energy transition assets benefit from increases in electricity prices, unlike other asset classes and non-energy infrastructure, where electricity is a major cost input. Resource/weather risk: Few other parts of a portfolio are as meaningfully impacted, positively or negatively, by meteorological factors as renewables assets. Technology risk: Each renewable technology and asset, whether it is a solar park or a wind farm, carries specific risks – and diversification opportunities. Geography/policy risk: Policy and regulation supporting the energy transition are rapidly developing in most regions around the world, providing a favourable investment climate. These differentiated risk premia associated with energy-transition assets result in robust diversification benefits. Correlation data supports this, with energy-transition infrastructure demonstrating low year-on-year return correlation to all asset classes – including diversified infrastructure – and even negative correlations to more economically cyclical equity and fixed income assets. So, while the overall, long-term risk and return of energy-transition infrastructure has historically been broadly similar to traditional infrastructure, the underlying “pattern” and drivers of returns are very different. This in turn suggests that including an energy-transition allocation, even in place of diversified infrastructure, has the potential to bring positive diversification benefits to portfolios. Energy investment as a primary focus The second reason is that energy transition assets are part of the infrastructure market that is growing. New capital is expected to be constantly required over the next 20 to 30 years to build out a new, sustainable global energy system, and respond to significant ongoing growth in energy demand. In terms of deal activity in global infrastructure, energy is by far the largest sector by deal volume. Within this, renewable energy is by a wide margin the largest energy sub-sector – and is, in fact, the largest single sector within infrastructure as a whole, accounting for 48 per cent of all investment over the past 15 years. The growth in renewable investment opportunities is of crucial importance, as it speaks not only to the opportunity set, but also to pricing. As a growing market, the energy sector needs to consistently incentivise and attract capital. New opportunities are consistently being developed, requiring capital at all stages of an investment’s life cycle, from earlier stages of development to investment in assets that developers, utilities or investors have already taken through construction and into operations, allowing them to recycle capital into new projects. With many developers’ capital constrained, the requirement to recycle capital through the sale of operational assets is particularly pronounced in today’s market, contributing to a scenario where there are motivated sellers, which in turn can help to underpin strong returns. The accompanying chart shows the levered discount rate (effectively the expected rate of return) of a portfolio of wind assets held in a listed investment trust managed by Schroders Greencoat, which shows that the rate today is at a higher level than it has been over the past 10 years. Given a relatively consistent risk profile over that time, especially over the past three to four years, this rise has primarily been driven by two key factors. The first is increasing bond yields, which necessitate higher returns to maintain risk-adjusted premiums over risk-free rates (returns from low-risk treasury bonds). The second, equally important, factor is this market dynamic between buyers and sellers. Sustainability risks and benefits The third reason is that we believe that there are environmental and sustainability benefits to investing in energy transition. Regardless of an individual’s stance on climate change and net zero, it’s nearly impossible to dispute that it is a key trend significantly influencing economies, markets, and both domestic and global politics. Crucially, the path to net zero is often drawn by economists as a straight line, but those who follow history will recognise that any economic transformation is not without its volatility; it is likely that there will be “energy-transition shocks” along the way. In those times, which are likely to lead to energy prices and inflationary spikes, energy-transition assets are positioned to perform well. A recent example of this occurred in 2022, when as a result of the Russia/Ukraine conflict and related energy security issues, we observed global spikes in power prices and inflation. Energy-transition infrastructure strategies performed positively, while other asset classes generally struggled – and equities and bonds both recorded negative returns for the first time in half a century. In conclusion, energy transition offers exposures and risk premia that are materially different in a portfolio context, including diversified infrastructure. These exposures translate into a very low correlation between underlying returns and the drivers of returns, even if historical risk and return metrics have been broadly similar. Moreover, there is potential for the unique return drivers within the energy-transition infrastructure to produce outperformance as the global energy transition evolves.

AP As India progresses toward its ambitious renewable energy goals, the upcoming Union Budget holds significant potential to pave the way for a more sustainable and energy-secure future. The renewable energy sector is a cornerstone of India’s climate commitments, with the nation striving to achieve 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030. However, realizing this vision requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses challenges in domestic manufacturing, import dependency, policy predictability, and stakeholder collaboration. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD One of the most pressing issues in the renewable energy landscape is the delicate balance between imposing duties on imports and fostering a robust domestic manufacturing ecosystem. Recent government measures, such as Basic Customs Duty (BCD) on imported solar modules and cells, aim to reduce dependency on foreign markets. However, the timing and quantum of such duties must be carefully calibrated to avoid supply chain disruptions. While these duties incentivise domestic production, they also raise project costs in the short term, potentially delaying adoption. To counterbalance this, the government must extend and strengthen schemes like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) to provide a competitive edge to Indian manufacturers.

However, to truly match global competition, further investment in research and development (R&D) is essential. Domestic players must be equipped with the technology and innovation to produce high-efficiency solar cells, modules, and wind turbines at competitive costs. The budget should allocate dedicated funds for renewable energy R&D, enabling India to leapfrog in global energy technology leadership. While policies governing the renewable energy sector have significantly evolved, further refinement is required to enhance their structure, predictability, and transparency. Stakeholders, including consumers, discoms (distribution companies), transmission companies, and financiers, thrive in an environment of clarity and trust. Policies must be aligned with the realities of implementation, offering scalability and mitigating risks for investors. For instance, ensuring clear guidelines on open access charges and timely approvals for projects will foster confidence among developers and financiers alike. Impact Shorts More Shorts Chennai Ranks #1 in Challan Checks: ACKO Insights for Smarter Car and Two Wheeler Insurance Decisions Tata Harrier EV vs Mahindra XEV 9e: Design and road presence compared Uniform state policies will play a pivotal role in achieving widespread renewable energy adoption. India’s federal structure often results in varying regulations across states, creating challenges for developers operating nationwide. The budget should encourage states to harmonise their renewable energy policies, including measures such as standardized net metering frameworks and streamlined energy banking mechanisms. Simplified and investor-friendly policies will reduce barriers to adoption, benefiting both consumers and businesses. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD An often-overlooked aspect of renewable energy adoption is the importance of round-the-clock (RTC) power. Integrating renewables into the grid at scale necessitates advancements in storage technology and ancillary services. Pro-consumer measures like energy banking and open access charges can provide the flexibility needed for RTC power availability. Similarly, extending subsidies or tax incentives for energy storage solutions will accelerate their adoption, enabling a more reliable and resilient renewable energy ecosystem. Achieving India’s renewable energy aspirations will require unprecedented collaboration among stakeholders. Consumers need access to affordable and clean energy, discoms must embrace innovative business models, transmission companies must modernize infrastructure, and financiers must deploy patient capital for long-term gains. Public-private partnerships can catalyze this ecosystem, providing the necessary resources and expertise to overcome current challenges. India’s renewable energy journey is also a critical component of its economic growth story. The sector has the potential to generate millions of jobs, enhance energy security, and reduce carbon emissions. By addressing key bottlenecks in manufacturing, policy clarity, and state-level coordination, the Union Budget can lay a strong foundation for the next phase of India’s energy transformation. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Accelerating the adoption of renewable energy requires a delicate balance between imposing duties to curb imports and fostering a robust domestic manufacturing ecosystem. Incentivizing domestic manufacturers through PLI and R&D investments is crucial to match global competition. Uniform state policies and support for RTC power are equally critical to streamline implementation and drive widespread adoption. In conclusion, the upcoming budget must be visionary yet pragmatic, addressing immediate challenges while laying the groundwork for long-term sustainability. A structured and collaborative approach will ensure that India not only meets its renewable energy targets but also becomes a global leader in clean energy innovation.

Article Insights Connor McCulloch’s articles from Ankura Consulting Group LLC are most popular: in United States with readers working within the Aerospace & Defence industries Ankura Consulting Group LLC are most popular: within Compliance, Insurance and Wealth Management topic(s) At his Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday, January 15, 2024, Energy Secretary nominee Chris Wright walked a careful line on renewable energy while emphasizing his vision of "affordable, reliable, secure American energy" from all sources. Wright, the CEO of Liberty Energy who was nominated by President-elect Donald Trump, faced questions about his past statements on climate change and his approach to the energy transition. In a nearly three-hour hearing marked by occasional climate protests and pointed questions about his views on wildfires and climate change, Wright described himself as a "science geek turned tech nerd turned lifelong energy entrepreneur." His nomination comes at a time when electricity demand is projected to grow by 15% in the next five years, driven by artificial intelligence technologies and increased manufacturing. Key Takeaways 1. Wright displayed a nuanced stance on renewables. Despite initial skepticism from some committee members about his commitment to renewable energy, Wright worked to present a more balanced perspective. His background in multiple energy sectors, including early work in solar energy and current investments in geothermal and nuclear technology, became a recurring theme throughout the hearing. "I worked on solar energy at UC Berkeley," Wright told senators, noting that his company Liberty Energy has partnerships in "next-generation geothermal and has partnerships in next-generation nuclear energy and new battery technology." When pressed by Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) about past statements suggesting renewables would remain in "single digits" globally, Wright clarified he was referring to total global energy consumption rather than electricity generation, acknowledging the significant growth of renewables in U.S. power generation. 2. Wright emphasized that the DOE under his leadership will focus on innovation and technology. He positioned technological advancement as central to his vision for the department, particularly in addressing climate challenges. Throughout his testimony, he emphasized the critical role of innovation in meeting America's energy needs. "The solution to climate change is to evolve our energy system," Wright said. "Are there things we can do – investments together through the Department of Energy – to accelerate development of new energy technologies that are really the only pathway to address climate change? Absolutely." He showed particular enthusiasm for geothermal energy, describing it as having "tremendous potential" and explaining how new technologies could unlock heat resources "below everyone's feet." 3. Wright emphasized that he will seek a balance between environment and affordability. A significant portion of the hearing focused on Wright's approach to balancing environmental concerns with economic realities. He repeatedly emphasized the need to consider both climate impacts and energy affordability. "Ten percent of Americans got a disconnection notice to their utilities in the last 12 months," Wright noted in his closing remarks. "More than 20 percent of Americans report struggles paying their bills, whether it's paying their energy bills, whether it's filling their car with gas or heating their home or paying their electricity bill." He also repeatedly acknowledged climate change as "a real and global phenomenon," while arguing for a comprehensive approach to energy policy that maintains reliability and affordability while reducing emissions through technological innovation. 4. Wright emphasized that nuclear energy is a key priority. Nuclear energy emerged as a key priority in Wright's vision for America's energy future. His enthusiasm for both traditional and new nuclear technologies was evident throughout the hearing. "The United States invented the technology of nuclear first for abrupt-action weapons and then for commercial nuclear power. Of course, we should lead in that," Wright said. He expressed concern about America's diminished uranium enrichment capabilities and voiced strong support for small modular reactors (SMRs), suggesting they could help overcome the cost and construction time challenges that have hindered nuclear expansion. 5. Wright noted that national labs will drive the research agenda of the U.S. Wright repeatedly emphasized the crucial role of scientific research in advancing America's energy goals. The Department of Energy's national laboratory system featured prominently in his vision for the agency's future. "Our labs have been pioneers in energy innovation across the spectrum," Wright said. He committed to keeping the labs "focused and energized to work on science -- basic fundamental science but also science will someday and maybe someday soon have applications to energy." When pressed about maintaining scientific integrity, Wright promised to "follow the scientific method" and ensure the publication of non-classified Department of Energy research. If confirmed, Wright would lead a department responsible for managing the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile, overseeing 17 national laboratories, and implementing and managing major clean energy programs and investments passed under the Biden administration. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources is expected to vote on Wright's nomination in the coming weeks.

View all partners DOI https://doi.org/10.64628/AAJ.f4d7cymye The world is fast transitioning towards renewable energy systems. But in many African countries, this transition is not solving historical inequalities or socio-economic challenges. This is because moving away from fossil fuels is costly and governments have largely not involved historically disadvantaged communities in the transition. Instead, African countries are focusing on how much clean energy technology costs and how to get companies to invest in it. Government and policymakers are overlooking concerns about social equity , environmental protection and political inclusion . This can lead to human rights violations and protests by communities who oppose renewable energy projects because they fear a repeat of past injustices associated with extractive projects, such as losing their land. The shift to renewable energy must be a just transition . It must not leave behind people who currently lack electricity. The justice dimension must be included in energy policies in African countries. We are research specialists in the fields of business and human rights, law and development, resource governance, energy, environment, and African development. We investigated how energy justice principles can guide and shape the green transition in Africa. These principles are geared towards the social, ethical and environmental aspects of producing, distributing and consuming energy. Energy justice sets out to ensure that energy is delivered to everyone in a sustainable way. Read more: Green energy: South Africa’s transition plan must be careful not to deepen inequality – the 3 top issues We looked at laws, articles, research databases and government reports on energy justice. We also examined reports from African countries on the just transition, on human rights-based approaches to energy and on the role of renewable energy sources in Africa today. About 600 million African people still lack access to reliable and affordable energy. Our research found that this energy poverty creates barriers to development and human rights concerns. For example, it stifles industrial growth and limits the productivity of small and medium-sized businesses. It reduces agricultural efficiency (for example, irrigation systems need energy). It reduces access to education – students study by poor lighting and have no way to charge devices. Healthcare (a lack of refrigeration for vaccines) is affected. And people don’t have clean cooking technologies like electric ovens. Our findings indicate that the transition to renewable energy must primarily aim to eradicate energy poverty. This requires careful planning, and co-operation between all organisations, communities and institutions involved in providing energy. It also needs targeted interventions to suit different African countries. Africa’s complicated energy transition Africa’s energy landscape is still shaped by inequality and exclusion that dates back to colonial times. Colonial-era infrastructure and development prioritised urban centres and extractive industries , such as coal and gold mines. Vast rural populations were deprived – and remain so. The transition must expand energy access at the same time as introducing low-carbon energy systems. This is a dual challenge which creates tensions between development needs and environmental sustainability goals. For instance, South Africa, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola rely heavily on fossil fuel revenues and extractive industries. This creates resistance to adopting renewable energy policies. Read more: South Africa's move to green energy was slowed down by government to protect coal mining When making the change, communities dependent on industries like coal mining face job losses. They have limited opportunities to find other sources of income. Workers in fossil fuel sectors lose their jobs and don’t get enough support (like training) to find other work in renewable energy. When this happens, food security and incomes are reduced, and rural poverty becomes worse. Some communities are displaced from their land to make way for big renewable energy projects. This weakens community cohesion and undermines trust in government and developers. Communities usually have little access to legal recourse or compensation when big companies expropriate land. Social justice is part of energy justice. It is essential to make a concerted and transparent effort to dismantle barriers to energy justice, to include all groups who may be at the margins of society in various ways. Unclear rules and weak government practices in many African countries also make it difficult to plan the energy transition effectively. Poor management and lack of enforcement of environmental laws add to the difficulties. Another problem is that although developed countries have pledged financial support to African nations for the transition, the amount of money they’ve disbursed has fallen short . This leaves African nations with insufficient resources to invest in renewable energy infrastructure and the just transition. How to end energy injustice Our research found that it is possible for the transition to give everyone access to clean, green energy. This will happen if governments integrate energy justice into all their energy policies. Governments can start by making sure that rural and historically disadvantaged communities are put first. African governments should reduce their dependence on extractive industries such as mining. Investing in renewable energy industries and creating new employment opportunities through green job initiatives can help with this. The impact of renewable energy projects on the environment and people must be carefully investigated. Communities need to be fully involved in planning large renewable energy projects. People who are displaced by energy projects must be compensated. The benefits of green energy must be shared with affected communities. Policymakers need to create clear, fair and enforceable rules and laws to make sure that clean energy is delivered in a just way. Stronger institutions, actions to prevent corruption, and training programmes are essential to make these rules work. Energy Peace and Security RandD Energy justice energy access Green transition

When it comes to saving money, Steph McGovern is here to help Britons switch things up at home to secure the best energy rates (Picture: Smart Energy GB) From that regular Sunday roast to our favourite Indian takeaway, you might think that Britons are creatures of habit. However, research carried out by Smart Energy GB† showed that we’re actually a nation that’s happy to switch it up for a positive outcome. And with energy prices remaining high, 64 per cent of Britons are changing their routines and becoming more flexible to save money, with 56 per cent specifically looking to save energy. An impressive 40 per cent of Britons have adapted their daily routines in the past year. Almost a quarter say they consider the time of day when doing high energy-consuming tasks, and 70 per cent have changed the way they plan their meals by doing more batch cooking. Is batch cooking the key to saving energy? 70 per cent of us swear by it, whereas others limit the number of appliances they run at the same time (Picture: Getty Images) Unsurprisingly, a majority do so to save money and energy, but many people were also happy to find that adapting their routines helped them to be more efficient and save time. Playing smart Consumer finance expert and TV presenter Steph McGovern has been working with Smart Energy GB to explore how much energy and money can be saved at home, and just how easy it can be. Energy reward schemes can suit our changing schedules and help us save money on bills. These flexible schemes can be easily accessed by households with a smart meter, and are designed to help reward customers for using energy at different times of the day. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Up Next Previous Page Next Page They’re offered by many energy providers and encourage households to shift their energy usage away from peak hours, either by rewarding them for using less energy when demand is very high or by offering cheaper energy when demand is lower. The smart meter’s handy display helps households keep a close eye on what they’re spending on energy (Picture: Smart Energy GB) If you have a smart meter installed, the financial benefit is clear, with many households believing they save up to £140 in a year by having one in their home. ‘I always want to make sure that I’m helping people make their money work harder for them, and it’s something I’m conscious of implementing in my own life too,’ said Steph. ‘It can be easy to put off these admin jobs like getting a smart meter, but it’s clear that by opening up access to reward schemes, there is a whole world of opportunities for saving.’ Six ways to save If you’re looking to join the flexible Britons who are switching up their routines to enjoy energy savings, here are some key changes that Steph suggests so you can enjoy keeping more of that hard-earned money in your account. 1. Get a smart meter The first step to saving energy is becoming more aware of how much you’re using – something the smart meter was designed to help you with (Picture: Smart Energy GB) Your smart meter display shows you how much energy your household uses in near-real time. Checking it regularly is a quick and easy way to track usage, identify power-hungry appliances and stay on top of your bills. 2. Sign up for a reward scheme With a smart meter, you could be eligible to sign up for a reward scheme from your energy supplier and benefit from extra savings. They will alert you when you can take part, so you can move your energy-intensive chores to a different time. Nearly nine in ten (87 per cent) of people who are taking part in an energy reward scheme say they are saving money on their bills. 3. Batch cook Appliances like ovens can use up a lot of energy. Batch cooking food together, when you have the oven on, means you can minimise usage and reduce energy consumption. 4. Time your laundry Modern washing machines often feature built-in timers, allowing users to schedule cycles during off-peak energy hours (Picture: Smart Energy GB) Most washing machines these days come with built-in timers. If you’re taking part in an energy reward scheme, you can easily load up the machine and set it to start operating only when cheaper, off-peak energy rates come into effect. In fact, nearly half of Britons say they are open to being more flexible when it comes to when they do their laundry. 5. Use more efficient appliances It might be time for an upgrade. Older machines are usually less efficient and consume more energy. If an old appliance has come to the end of its life, check the energy efficiency rating of any replacements and choose the most efficient you can. The extra investment will soon pay for itself. 6. Remember to adjust your heating It’s surprising how quickly the little things can add up! Make sure you turn the heating down or even off when you’re not going to be at home. Timer devices can help with this or, if you have a smart home set-up, you can easily control your heating – and even lighting and appliances – flexibly from wherever you are. Want to keep a closer eye on your usage? Get a smart meter today! * Here’s how we save London couple Michael and Johnny save money by taking part in their supplier’s energy reward scheme (Picture: Smart Energy GB) Steph visited two households to learn about their strategies for saving energy and reducing monthly bills. Michael and Johnny from London, save on their bills and get rewards and vouchers for using energy more flexibly. ‘It’s super easy and straightforward,’ Michael explained. ‘We get a notification via the app, I’ll put it in our diary to say electricity is going to be cheaper at this time, and then we’ll know to plan around it.’ ‘We were already tracking our energy usage with our smart meter display,’ added Johnny. ‘But now we know when to spend and when to save. When we get the notification, it’s ‘go time’; we charge the car, put the dishwasher on and do some batch baking. We just run the house so much more efficiently.’ Steph also met housemates Felicia and Naiema, also from London, who are reward scheme converts. Felicia, the ‘discount queen,’ and Naiema embrace saving energy and earning rewards with enthusiasm (Picture: Smart Energy GB) Felicia wished she had found out about them earlier. ‘I would have been the first person to sign up. I’m a discount queen!’ she said. Naiema added: ‘We already do things to save energy, like making sure wash loads are full and cooking together, but we could definitely be more flexible and take advantage of a reward scheme.’ Find more money-saving tips at SmartEnergyGB.org †Research conducted by OnePoll across 2,000 UK adults, December 2024. *Eligibility may vary.

78.5% of all respondents said they would like to see nuclear energy as part of Australia's energy mix in the next 25yrs 86.3% of all respondents cited the reliability of nuclear energy as a power source as the main benefit/opportunity of nuclear energy in Australia 73.9% of all respondents cited public opinion as the main barriers to/challenges with nuclear energy in Australia PERTH, Australia , Jan. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Despite the ongoing public debate kicked off by Coalition's plans for a nuclear-powered Australia if elected in 2025's general election, people working within the energy and resources sector are strongly in favour nuclear energy having a role in Australia's future energy mix. That's according to a new survey by Energy News Bulletin - the APAC region's most comprehensive source of daily energy news - who have surveyed their readers on attitudes towards nuclear power in Australia . The headline finding in the Future of Energy: Nuclear power in Australia report is that more than three quarters (78.5%) want to see nuclear energy as part of the country's before 2050 and just over two thirds (67%) see nuclear energy becoming a part of Australia's energy mix in the next 25 years. Russell Yeo , Energy News Bulletin's managing editor, says those working within the energy resources sectors - some of the most engaged and informed people in the country on the issue of nuclear energy - have spoken clearly on their support for the divisive energy option. "We compared these figures to the findings of similar, recently conducted surveys of the Australian population and found support for nuclear energy is higher in the energy sector.

"Polls varies but our figure of 78.5% is noticeably higher than 61% found in a recent Lowy Institute survey," he said. In the wake of Peter Dutton releasing the costings for his nuclear energy policy, the ENB survey found eight in ten think the Albanese government's opposition to nuclear power in Australia is mainly ideological, against less than a fifth (15.8%) saying it's an economic objection. Similarly, just over two thirds (70.8%) think the Australian general population's opposition to nuclear power in Australia is mainly ideological. Advertisement "What's clear through the public debate which has been happening since Dutton announced his plans in June 2024 is that peoples' opinions are very entrenched on both sides of the argument. "It's going to be fascinating seeing how much of a political Sherrin this issue is in the run up to the general election," added Yeo.

3 household appliances you should not leave on standby — they increase your energy bills Leaving certain appliances on standby can still consume electricity What's On Angela Patrone Senior Lifestyle Reporter 13:38, 27 Jan 2025 View Image These three household appliances should not be left on standby — they increase your energy bills (Image: (Image: Getty)) Energy bills have been fluctuating wildly over the past two years. Although they've retreated from the record highs of late 2023 and early 2024, they remain steep and unaffordable for many. ‌ One common household habit that could be preventing maximum savings on energy bills is leaving certain appliances on standby. ‌ Even when not in use, some devices can continue to draw electricity if left plugged in - with some being more culpable than others, reports the Express . ‌ The energy experts at Free Heating Scheme have identified three appliances that should "never be left on standby mode". In this context, 'standby' refers to appliances being left plugged in with the socket switched on. They explained: "Leaving devices on standby may seem like a time-saver, but it can steadily consume energy and drive up your electricity bills. Although standby mode uses less power than when a device is fully operational, many appliances still draw electricity even when they appear to be off. Over time, this hidden energy use can accumulate, contributing to the escalating energy costs many households are grappling with this winter." 1. Satellite boxes Satellite boxes are commonplace appliances that can have a "surprising impact" on your energy bills. Despite having a standby mode designed to minimise power consumption, these devices still "draw a significant amount of energy even when not in active use". ‌ Many people think that leaving their satellite box on standby is enough, but just turning off the TV and keeping the box in standby mode can "result in unnecessary energy consumption" which adds up over time. Satellite boxes can be "big energy drainers", and properly turning them off when not needed can lead to a "noticeable reduction in your energy bill". 2. Desktop computers Leaving a desktop computer in standby might make for quicker log-ins, yet it can also "drive up your energy costs". Pros caution that "Even in standby, desktop computers consume electricity, which can become expensive with time." ‌ On average, a desktop on standby could increase your electricity bill by about £10 to £15 every year. Though this might not seem much, completely switching off your desktop when not in use can add up to meaningful savings. Such small behavioural adjustments can impact your total energy bills significantly. 3. Games consoles Modern gaming consoles are designed with energy-saving features, but they still have disadvantages. These systems usually include an on/off button that puts them into a low-power standby state. Article continues below Nonetheless, many users either forget to power down their consoles entirely or leave them on whilst turning off the TV, resulting in avoidable energy expenses. Experts suggest that games consoles can account for around six percent of the average household's energy bill. Although the percentage may not seem significant, regularly switching off your console can lead to considerable savings over time. The Energy Saving Trust also recommends keeping your console up-to-date, as this can enhance its energy efficiency.

Good Energy agrees takeover by firm linked to United Arab Emirates' Royal family The deal comes after the deadline for a firm offer was extended three times, and Good Energy said the takeover deal is a 'good deal which will ramp up the company's renewable purpose' Money Lawrence Matheson and Holly Williams PA Business Editor 11:48, 27 Jan 2025 View Image Good Energy has agreed to a sweetened £99.4m takeover by Esyasoft, a company with links to the United Arab Emirates’ royals (Image: PA Archive/PA Images) Good Energy has accepted a revised £99.4m takeover bid from Dubai-based Esyasoft, a company with ties to the United Arab Emirates' Royal family . ‌ The offer of 490p per share comes after Esyasoft initially expressed interest in a 412p-per-share deal in late October, which Good Energy deemed an "unsolicited" approach that undervalued the company's growth potential. ‌ However, with the agreed-upon takeover, Good Energy believes it has secured "a good deal which will ramp up the company’s renewable purpose". Chief executive Nigel Pocklington stated: "Today we have an opportunity with a partner that shares our sustainable energy vision and has the resources to accelerate our purpose substantially." ‌ He added that while the board remains confident in Good Energy's strategy as a publicly listed company, Esyasoft's financial resources and presence in new markets significantly enhance their potential. Juliet Davenport, Good Energy's founder and former chief executive, reflected on the company's 25-year history, saying: "I founded Good Energy 25 years ago to be a pioneer in the provision of clean power to all customers in the UK." She noted the vast changes in the energy industry since then, which was previously dominated by fossil fuels and a centralized system. Good Energy, a UK-based renewable energy company, is on the brink of a significant expansion with a new investor that could revolutionise its clean power offerings. ‌ "This new investor for Good Energy offers an opportunity to scale the Good Energy propositions leading the decentralised and flexible clean power offering for the prosumers of the future to make a real difference to climate change." While shareholder approval is pending, if the deal gets the nod, it's expected to be finalised in the first half of 2025. Esyasoft, the potential investor, touts itself as a pioneer in "smart grid" technology , employing artificial intelligence and data-driven tech to upgrade the electricity grid. According to previous stock exchange disclosures, Esyasoft falls under the control of the Abu Dhabi International Holding Company (IHC), chaired by Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who is part of the UAE founder's family and the Abu Dhabi Royal family. ‌ Established in 1999, Good Energy has grown to serve around 275,000 customers across the UK. Although not one of the Big Six energy firms, Good Energy's directors were involved in discussions with Labour’s energy consumers minister, Miatta Fahnbulleh, at the end of August, focusing on how companies can assist bill-payers amid rising energy costs. The announcement of the deal sent Good Energy's shares soaring by 22% on Monday morning, adding to a nearly 65% rise over the past six months, largely attributed to Esyasoft's expressed interest in acquiring a stake in the company. Bipin Chandra, the brain behind Esyasoft and its chief executive, has expressed his company's commitment to aiding businesses that are crucial in energy infrastructures and climate technology sectors. He said: "We have a strong track record of supporting businesses involved in critical energy infrastructure and climate technologies, and therefore our portfolio of services is highly complementary to Good Energy’s. Article continues below "We believe that, through our strategic partnership, we can support Good Energy in accelerating delivery of its purpose and growth ambitions by realising the extensive opportunities that exist for this business both in the UK and internationally." His words reflect not only Esyasoft's robust experience but also its eagerness to work alongside Good Energy, tapping into the enormous potential for expansion within and beyond the UK.

With an ambitious target of achieving 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, this year’s budget must set a bold and actionable roadmap to overcome current challenges while laying the foundation for long-term growth. This is more than just a fiscal exercise—it is a decisive step in reshaping the way India powers its industries, cities and villages in alignment with economic progress and environmental responsibility. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Ambition meets infrastructure India’s renewable energy ambition is unparalleled, but the scale of transformation required is equally daunting. To achieve its 2030 target, the country must triple its annual capacity additions from the current 28 GW to 50–60 GW. However, infrastructure limitations, particularly in transmission and power evacuation, threaten to slow progress. More from Business Hyundai India’s Rs 27,870 crore IPO oversubscribed by 2.28X, largely driven by institutional investors How Indian fintech startups are driving Malaysia’s UPI-like digital payments revolution The Green Energy Corridor (GEC) Phase III is pivotal in addressing these challenges. Renewable- rich states like Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are central to India’s energy transition, but power evacuation infrastructure in these states remains underdeveloped. By prioritizing investments in interstate transmission systems, the budget can ensure seamless power flow from generation hubs to consumption centers. Additionally, subsidies for smart grid technologies and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) will be critical to managing grid stability as renewable energy’s share in the energy mix increases. Strengthening domestic manufacturing India’s vision of becoming a self-reliant energy powerhouse and global manufacturing hub hinges on building a robust domestic manufacturing ecosystem. While the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme has bolstered solar panel and module production, it must now extend to upstream components such as polysilicon, wafers, and solar glass. This will reduce dependency on imports, lower costs, and create employment opportunities while positioning India to serve worldwide demand for renewable energy components.

Rationalising customs duties on raw materials and standardizing GST rates for renewable energy equipment will further enhance the financial viability of domestic manufacturing. By fostering innovation and creating a competitive ecosystem, India can secure its position as a global leader in renewable energy production and emerge as a key supplier to meet international clean energy requirements. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD The role of green hydrogen As the global energy landscape evolves, green hydrogen has emerged as a key player in decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors like steel, cement, and long-haul transportation. India has the potential to lead this revolution, but its green hydrogen ecosystem is still in its infancy. The Union Budget 2025 must allocate significant resources to accelerate green hydrogen adoption. Targeted subsidies, pilot projects, and infrastructure investments will help scale production and reduce costs. Beyond its environmental benefits, green hydrogen represents an economic opportunity, capable of generating jobs, attracting foreign investment, and positioning India as a global hub for clean energy technologies. Tackling energy storage and grid stability Energy storage is no longer an option, it is an essential component of India’s renewable energy future. Solar and wind power’s inherent intermittency requires advanced storage solutions to ensure a reliable power supply. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) can stabilize the grid and enable efficient integration of renewable energy into the power system. The government must introduce subsidies and tax incentives for large-scale BESS projects. Coupled with investments in DISCOM modernization and digital solutions like AI-powered smart meters, these measures can reduce transmission and distribution losses while improving overall efficiency. Strengthening the grid’s resilience is key to supporting India’s renewable energy ambitions. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Unlocking rooftop solar potential Rooftop solar represents a tremendous opportunity for decentralized clean energy generation. However, its adoption has been hampered by regulatory hurdles and limited financial support. The budget must address these challenges by simplifying approval processes, providing financing options, and removing state-imposed caps on rooftop solar capacity for industrial establishments. Incentives for battery-backed rooftop solar systems can further increase their appeal, offering both energy independence and grid support. Expanding rooftop solar adoption across residential and commercial sectors is a low-hanging fruit in India’s energy transition. Financial support for long-term stability Achieving India’s renewable energy targets will require unprecedented financial support. Extending the concessional 15 per cent tax rate under Section 115BAB for renewable energy projects can provide developers with long-term stability. Reinstating lower withholding tax rates for external borrowings and exempting GST on Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) will reduce financial burdens and encourage investments. Further, the budget must incentivize private sector participation in transmission PGCIL) and similar initiatives could unlock latent investor interest and accelerate infrastructure development. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Green energy for a sustainable future India’s renewable energy journey is not just a story of targets and timelines—it is a vision for a sustainable and equitable future. The Union Budget 2025 offers a golden opportunity to accelerate this transition by addressing structural challenges, incentivizing clean energy solutions, and fostering innovation. From transmission infrastructure and domestic manufacturing to green hydrogen and energy storage, the budget must deliver a comprehensive strategy that balances ambition with action. This is not just about meeting the 2030 target, it is about positioning India as a global leader in clean energy, creating jobs, and building an energy ecosystem that future generations can be proud of. The time for incremental changes is over. The Union Budget 2025 must act as a blueprint for India’s green energy revolution, demonstrating that economic growth and environmental sustainability are not mutually exclusive but interdependent. By making bold choices now, India can pave the way for a cleaner, brighter future. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD The author is Chairman and Managing Director of Apollo International Group.

Mario Draghi was awarded the international "PoliTO Foresight and Innovation" prize TURIN, Italy, Jan. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The EU-Italy Energy Days , organized by Politecnico di Torino in collaboration with the Italian Ministry for the Environment and Energy Security , and with the full support of the Italian Ministry for Universities and Research , and the European Commission, ended today with the awarding to Mario Draghi of the first international “PoliTO Foresight and Innovation” prize. The award was established by Politecnico di Torino to recognize the most exceptional European expertise in tackling the collective challenge of medium- to long-term innovation and renewal, at both the national and European levels. Professor Draghi was awarded upon the advice of the “ Energy & Climate High Level Group” . This international team of ten experts, hailing from France, Germany, Belgium, United Kingdom, Latvia, Finland, and Italy, is highly qualified in European economics, technology, law, and policy, and supports Politecnico in its mission to assist in policy-making. Professor Draghi was awarded for his extensive academic experience, his institutional assignments within Italian and European institutions, and his valuable contribution to EU innovation and competitiveness . The award ceremony crowns the two-day event organized by Politecnico for this second edition of the EU-Italy Energy Days , held on January 23 and 24, on the theme “How to Achieve Near-Zero Emissions by 2050.” A unique opportunity for key representatives from Italian ministries and European institutions to collaborate with international scientists in identifying innovative, socially acceptable, and economically viable solutions for implementing sustainable energy policies . In the impressive settings of the Valentino Castle – Politecnico’s historical venue – and of the National Museum of the Risorgimento, hosted in Palazzo Carignano, the program featured international experts from academia, industry and policymakers in critical discussions on topical issues, such as nuclear energy, hydrogen and CCS technologies, alternative fuels for transportation and renewable energy. Science plays a crucial role in supporting the European Commission’s “Energy and Climate” group, and key decision-makers among the member states such as Italy. Indeed, the main goals set by the President of the “ Von der Leyen II Commission" for the “Energy and Climate” group are aimed at ensuring the EU's future competitiveness through effective decarbonization , identifying numerous goals for both energy and climate commissioners, including reviewing fiscal policies, following up on National Energy and Climate Plans, and formulating policies for 2030. EU-Italy Energy Days international meeting aims precisely to connect research, institutions and policy makers on these issues. This is why four panel discussions were held on Thursday, January 23 rd : “Nuclear Energy: Innovative Technologies and Prospects”; “Planning National Strategies for Hydrogen and CCS”; “Decarbonization in Transportation”; “Innovative Strategies to Promote the Energy Transition.” On Friday, January 24 th , greetings were held by Politecnico’s Rector Stefano Corgnati , Symposium Chairman Giovanni Federigo De Santi , Piedmont Region Vice President Elena Chiorino, and Turin’s Mayor Stefano Lo Russo . Then, the European Parliament member and ITRE Committee Vice Chairman Giorgio Gori , together with the Minister of the Environment and Energy Security Gilberto Pichetto Fratin launched the debate on “ Energy Transition: priorities in the European and Italian policy agenda”. The concluding panel entitled “ Energy Transition: Italian perspectives and future plans in the European context” hosted internationally renowned guests, with representatives from the corporate world and institutions. “This event aligns with one of the main objectives of our Strategic Plan, that is Politecnico di Torino's growing role in facilitating the dialogue on nowadays technological transformations, increasingly pervasive in our society. During the two-day “EU-ITALY Energy Days,” we eased discussions between the European Commission and the Ministry of Environment and Energy Security, together with academia and industry, thus playing a facilitating role for policy making,” comments Politecnico di Torino Rector Stefano Corgnati . “I am grateful for the invitation to this Symposium, which fosters a close dialogue between our country and the European Commission, and has been hosted by Politecnico di Torino, a top-level institution for transition technologies,” says Minister for the Environment and Energy Security Gilberto Pichetto Fratin , “This meeting is a key opportunity to discuss a crucial issue: how to successfully address the energy transition, maintaining economic competitiveness and ensuring energy supply security. Achieving the Net Zero goal in 2050 means sustainably decarbonizing the economy while ensuring the safety of energy supplies. In the nuclear field, I just submitted a few days ago to the Prime Minister's Office a draft bill to create a stable and investment-friendly regulatory framework. This draft law calls for the adoption of a National Sustainable Nuclear Program aimed at decarbonization, system stability and reduced energy costs for households and businesses. Our goal is clear: to build an energy system that is secure, resilient and competitive, responding to global challenges and enhancing Italian excellence. We are working to achieve all this .” “It is crucial to me that the debate of this two-day event in Turin focused on new technologies leading towards our country’s energy transition: from the new generation of nuclear power, with a key project developed right here in Turin, to the production of green hydrogen, up to the development of CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage)” - adds Giorgio Gori , European Parliament member and ITRE Committee Vice Chairman – “ All this said, the most pressing challenge that the European Union needs to face is the reduction of the energy costs. On February 26 th , the EU Commission will present the Action Plan to Ensure Affordable Energy Prices. I trust that this plan will include concrete and effective measures to support households and businesses, promoting an inclusive and fair energy transition. In Italy, this challenge is even more demanding. Our country, with its heavy dependence on gas, is paying a very high price for soaring energy costs. The situation is unsustainable and requires rapid and effective responses. The goal is to differentiate the price of energy from the price of gas, which in Italy determines 70 percent of the cost. The way is to increase the production of renewable energy – reducing the use of gas – and to promote a greater diffusion of long-term contracts. For all this, a key role can be played by the GSE.” For more information: Press Office LaPresse - ufficio.stampa@lapresse.it A photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/89254b2b-b06f-4e8e-939e-f175685fb8ff

Good Energy accepts raised takeover offer from UAE's Esyasoft Published on 01/27/2025 at 03:38 am EST - Modified on 01/27/2025 at 03:40 am EST Alliance News Share Good Energy Group PLC -.--% Euro / Dirham (EUR/AED) -0.08% US Dollar / Dirham (USD/AED) 0.00% (Alliance News) - Good Energy Group PLC on Monday said it has accepted a GBP99.4 million takeover offer from UAE-based suitor Esyasoft Holding Ltd, which sweetened its bid after an approach in October. Esyasoft's new offer for the Chippenham, England-based renewable electricity supplier and energy services provider is 490 pence per share in cash. It values Good Energy's equity at GBP99.4 million and implies an enterprise value of GBP67.8 million. In October, Esyasoft had made an approach at 412p per share. Good Energy said that tilt "was not a fair reflection of the future growth opportunities of the company". The new offer is a 66% premium to Good Energy's share price of 295p before Esyasoft's approach in October and 24% above Friday's close. Early Monday, Good Energy shares were up 21% to 476.52p. Esyasoft's new bid already has received the backing of 30% of Good Energy's shareholders. "The Good Energy board believes the cash offer from Esyasoft would provide Good Energy shareholders with an immediate realisation of this future value potential in cash at an attractive premium," the company said. Abu Dhabi-based Esyasoft is an 'energy-as-a-service' business, serving the power, water and gas market with its Smart Meter Data Management platform. It is part of the Dubai-headquartered Esyasoft Group, which makes 'internet of things' devices and software for energy distribution and management. Esyasoft Group in turn is owned by Sirius International Holdings Ltd, a subsidiary of International Holding Co PJSC, both holding companies based in Abu Dhabi. "What strikes us about Good Energy is how aligned it is both strategically and culturally with our own business," said Esyasoft Holding Chief Executive Officer & Founder Bipin Chandra. "Good Energy, like Esyasoft, is driven by a vision to deliver a smart, green and sustainable energy future for all."

Tinubu, other leaders tackle Africa’s energy woes in Tanzania By : Waliat Musa Date: 27 January 2025 6:17am WAT Share : President Bola Tinubu President Bola Tinubu. President Bola Tinubu has departed Abuja for Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to participate in the Africa Heads of State Energy Summit starting today. The summit, being hosted by the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania, the African Union, the African Development Bank Group (AfDB), and the World Bank Group, will bring together over 25 Heads of State and Governments, international organisations, energy experts and private sector leaders to forge a unified path toward achieving universal energy access. Tagged, Africa Energy Summit (AES), it is intended to boost universal energy access by 2030, as stakeholders gather to advance Mission 300, the organisers have said. The Vice President for Power, Energy, Climate, and Green Growth, AfDB, Kevin Kariuki, described energy as the engine of development, emphasising that without affordable, reliable, and sustainable electricity, Africa could not achieve its developmental aspirations or secure its rightful place in the global economy. He added that the success of Mission 300 is not only about electrification, but also about saving and empowering lives, transforming communities, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and safeguarding biodiversity. He pointed out that at the current pace of electrification, combined with Africa’s rapid population growth, the number of people living without access to electricity could remain largely unchanged. Kariuki emphasised that Mission 300 would provide a clear roadmap to achieve universal energy access by 2030. He mentioned that the principal outcomes of the summit included the adoption of the Dar es Salaam Energy Declaration by the entire continent and the co-creation of 12 country energy compacts between countries and the Mission 300 partners.

The twelve countries that will submit energy compacts account for almost half of the global population without access to electricity,” he stated. According to Tinubu’s spokesman, Bayo Onanuga, the President will join other African leaders, private sector leaders, development partners and civil society groups in Dar es Salaam to strategise to accelerate energy access across the continent. Onanuga stated that on the first day of the summit, Nigeria and other participating countries would present their national energy strategies, termed compacts, detailing their approaches to achieving universal energy access within five years. He stated that heads of state would endorse the Dar es Salaam Energy Declaration on the second day, outlining a unified roadmap for Africa’s progress towards the Mission 300 objectives. “President Tinubu will deliver a national statement reaffirming Nigeria’s commitment to achieving universal access to energy and its leadership role in Africa’s energy sector,” he noted. Joining the President on the trip are the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Bianca Odumegwu-Ojukwu; Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu; and the Special Adviser to the President on Energy, Olu Verheijen.

American energy needed to ‘lift up’ those who want to expand economically worldwide By Dave Avelia, Real Clear Wire January 26, 2025 For years, the debate surrounding America’s energy future has been obscured by politics, lip service, and hyperbole. The fact is at the heart of the “energy issue” is the question of human prosperity. How can we ensure that human beings are given the best chance to achieve their goals, better their situation, and provide for their families? Chris Wright isn’t just an advocate for responsible energy policy – he’s an advocate for humanity. He understands that energy is the foundation for any measurable advancements that lift-up the impoverished, feed the hungry, and shelter the homeless. Clean water, reliable food sources, and robust infrastructural improvements are only possible with energy policies that focus on expanding America’s load capacity and bringing down the price for consumers and businesses alike. This is why President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Chris Wright as our next Secretary of Energy has gotten much attention. Headlines will attempt to summarize his life as a “fracking executive,” but his life’s work and governing philosophy expands far beyond such shallow analysis. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! Far from an extremist or “climate denialist,” Chris Wright has openly engaged in the discussion of how we can lessen the impact humans have on the world around us. “Climate change is a global challenge,” Wright wrote last year in Liberty Energy’s 2024 Bettering Human Lives report. Alongside his role as CEO of Liberty Energy, Wright is also on the Board of Directors for Oklo, an American company that is revolutionizing the way we think of nuclear energy with their modular “Aurora Powerhouse” reactor. He also signed on to a 2023 declaration of energy executives that urged leaders to support the development of nuclear energy, in part, to “meaningfully de-carbonize its complex energy systems without derailing global economies.” That all said, Wright has never run from fracking – hydraulic fracturing – and its benefits. Because of the adoption of that process at scale, natural gas has become the leading energy source in the U.S., leading to a 12% decline in emissions between 2005 and 2015, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration. That was reinforced by the Institute for Energy Research six years later when they found that the U.S. led the world in reduction of carbon dioxide emissions since 2005. Even the Progressive Policy Institute agreed in a study that China purchasing American natural gas (versus Russian) would reduce emissions by an average of 30%. Unlike many in DC’s chatter class, Wright deals in facts. He supports an all-of-the-above energy policy that doesn’t require government bureaucrats to pick winners and losers. He supports responsible regulations that protect our land and water without stifling innovation and increasing utility costs for the rest of us. Wright describes himself as a climate realist – somebody who understands the tradeoffs between energy and climate policy. For many Americans, it is a much-needed mindset for leading the Department of Energy. A husband, father, and avid outdoorsman (skiing, cycling, and climbing), he believes in leaving the next generation a reasonable, human-focused energy system that is focused on bringing the most amount of prosperity to the most amount of people. Recent studies show that over 1 billion people on Earth are considered to be “energy poor.” That may seem inconceivable to Americans who are exposed to electrical lines, power outlets, EV charging stations, and streetlights on a daily basis, but for those billion human beings on the planet, that means an inability to grow beyond the means they were born into and achieve their potential. That’s where the continued expansion of American energy resources can continue to play a role. By unleashing American energy, we lift up those who need clean, reliable, and affordable fuel to expand economically. For human prosperity, this U.S. Senate should promptly confirm Chris Wright as our country’s next Energy Secretary. David Avella is GOPAC Chairman.

Oil is a volatile commodity, a fact that needs to be taken into consideration when buying an oil-related stock. However, there are different ways to view this fact from an investment perspective. Chevron ( CVX +0.26% ) , Devon Energy ( DVN +3.61% ) , and TotalEnergies ( TTE +1.64% ) offer three very different ways to dip your toes into oil stocks if you have $200, or more, to put to work. Here's a quick look at each one. 1. Chevron covers all the carbon energy bases Chevron is what is known as an integrated energy major. That means it invests in the upstream (oil and natural gas production), midstream (pipeline), and downstream (chemical and refining) segments of the broader energy industry . This diversification helps to even out earnings in what is a very volatile sector because each segment of the industry operates just a little bit differently. For example, when oil prices are low and the upstream business is suffering, the downstream businesses will be benefiting from low input costs. Expand NYSE : CVX Chevron Today's Change ( 0.26 %) $ 0.40 Current Price $ 156.05 Key Data Points Market Cap $313B Day's Range $ 155.90 - $ 157.99 52wk Range $ 132.04 - $ 168.96 Volume 214K Avg Vol 7.4M Gross Margin 13.60 % Dividend Yield 0.04 % While Chevron's diversification across the energy sector doesn't mitigate the impact that oil price swings have on the top and bottom line, it does soften the swings. That, along with the company's focus on having a strong balance sheet , have helped it survive through industry downturns while continuing to reward investors with dividend increases all along the way. Chevron's dividend has been increased annually for 37 consecutive years, which is pretty incredible given the wild oil price swings that have occurred over that span. If you want a reliable, high-yield energy stock (Chevron's yield is 4% today), Chevron is probably one of the best options out there. 2. Devon Energy is anything but reliable While Chevron is focused on consistency, Devon Energy offers pretty much the exact opposite. This company is focused on the U.S. upstream sector, producing oil and natural gas in key domestic energy basins. With no other businesses to offset the inherent volatility of selling these commodities, Devon's top and bottom lines are highly variable. That, in turn, leads the stock to rise and fall in dramatic fashion, moving right along with the big swings in energy prices. While it isn't a great idea to try to time markets, if you have a constructive view of oil prices, Devon Energy is likely to lead to more upside than investing in Chevron would. That said, remember that there's more downside risk, as well. Expand NYSE : DVN Devon Energy Today's Change ( 3.61 %) $ 1.23 Current Price $ 35.15 Key Data Points Market Cap $21B Day's Range $ 34.11 - $ 35.58 52wk Range $ 25.89 - $ 39.74 Volume 486K Avg Vol 7.3M Gross Margin 23.20 % Dividend Yield 0.03 % While this big-picture dynamic is likely to be the driving force when making an investment in Devon Energy, there are other factors of note. Devon Energy is a well-respected company with operations in multiple regions of the United States. It has an investment-grade-rated balance sheet, 10+ years of drilling inventory, and a low break-even point, so it can make money even if oil prices are a little weak. So buying Devon Energy isn't like throwing caution to the wind. It is more like making an educated bet on higher energy prices that won't likely fall to zero if you are wrong. 3. TotalEnergies is for investors that want to hedge their bets TotalEnergies competes directly with Chevron, since both are globally diversified integrated energy giants. Chevron is probably a better choice for most investors given that it has a more impressive dividend history. However, TotalEnergies has one very important thing that Chevron largely lacks: material exposure to electricity and clean energy . The company's integrated power division, as it is called, made up around 10% of adjusted net operating income through the first nine months of 2024. This figure grew 20% year over year. Expand NYSE : TTE TotalEnergies Today's Change ( 1.64 %) $ 1.03 Current Price $ 63.96 Key Data Points Market Cap $136B Day's Range $ 63.72 - $ 64.23 52wk Range $ 52.78 - $ 65.76 Volume 1M Avg Vol 1.3M Gross Margin 12.55 % Dividend Yield 0.06 % TotalEnergies has made a material commitment to clean energy, which offers a hedge of sorts for investors that are worried about the future of carbon fuels. But what's really notable about this is that TotalEnergies made this shift without cutting its dividend, which is what European peers BP and Shell did when they made similar clean energy commitments in 2020. Even more interesting, BP and Shell have started to walk back those commitments while TotalEnergies has continued to push forward. With an attractive 5.5% dividend yield , TotalEnergies is a good choice for investors looking for more than just oil. Three ways to play oil There's no single right way to invest in oil stocks -- use the way that makes the most sense to you. Chevron is a great choice if you simply want to buy and hold a diversified energy stock with an attractive yield and reliable dividend. Devon Energy is appropriate for more aggressive investors that think oil prices are heading higher. And TotalEnergies is a good call for investors that want oil exposure, but think that clean energy is going to be an increasingly important part of the global energy pie.

Yahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article. This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways Analysis of the levelized cost of energy shows how renewables have become more cost-efficient every year. Today, the least-expensive way to meet energy needs is with renewable resources. For industries at risk of power outages or those requiring always-on power, clean energy projects can offer a lifeline. Fundamentally, distributed energy resources (DERs) can give organizations a hedge against increasing energy costs, helping meet decarbonization goals and enabling cost-effective and sustainable electrification. Further, microgrid systems that balance how, when, and where electricity is used enable greater control over energy infrastructure. These systems often integrate existing onsite energy sources with DERs and storage—providing affordable power when energy prices are high, bolstering resilience when the grid is down, powering increasing electrical loads and reducing carbon footprint. Want to learn more about DERs and the decentralization of power generation. Read " Central Theme for Energy's Future: Decentralizing Power Generation " in the January 2025 issue of POWER . A prime example of this approach is the clean energy microgrid project completed last year at Eaton's Arecibo, Puerto Rico, manufacturing facility, where the company produces circuit breakers for residential, commercial, and industrial applications. This microgrid is a first-of-its-kind in Puerto Rico, and it significantly reduces the facility’s carbon footprint while enhancing energy resilience and supporting local infrastructure. [caption id="attachment_228216" align="alignnone" width="640"] The clean energy microgrid project was built by Eaton in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, in collaboration with Enel North America. It incorporates 5 MWac of solar photovoltaic panels, about 1.1 MW of battery storage, and existing onsite generators, at the manufacturing facility. Courtesy: Eaton [/caption] Eaton in September 2024 received the "International Energy Project of the Year" award from the Association of Energy Engineers (AEE) for the Arecibo project. An important first step of this project was simply reducing how much energy was consumed at the site. By implementing comprehensive energy efficiency measures, Eaton achieved a remarkable 45% reduction in energy usage at the plant. The addition of a solar-plus-storage microgrid improved the company's control over energy supply and costs. Collectively, these initiatives are significantly boosting Eaton's energy resilience, cutting carbon emissions and lowering energy expenditures by nearly 20%. [caption id="attachment_228217" align="alignnone" width="640"] The microgrid system at Eaton's Arecibo manufacturing facility incorporates solar plus storage, as well as the company's existing onsite generators to create robust energy infrastructure that’s designed to withstand the impact from extreme weather events. The company won the 2024 "International Energy Project of the Year" award from the Association of Energy Engineers for the clean energy project at its Arecibo facility. Courtesy: Eaton [/caption] The microgrid currently meets more than half of the facility's energy needs. It incorporates 5 MW (MWac) of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity and about 1.1 MW of battery storage, tying directly into existing onsite generators. This architecture can generate nearly 10 GWh of renewable energy annually, and prevents the release of about 7,100 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year. A key feature of this microgrid is its ability to balance electricity consumption based on real-time demand, providing greater control over onsite energy resources. This includes the ability to operate independently from the grid, ensuring continuous power supply during outages. [caption id="attachment_228218" align="alignnone" width="640"] Eaton manufacturers circuit breakers used in homes, buildings and industrial applications at its facility in Arecibo, Puerto Rico. Courtesy: Eaton [/caption] The microgrid is also engineered to withstand Category 5 hurricane-force winds, which was an integral design consideration for the island location. Further, in normal grid-connected conditions, the system can generate renewable energy that not only serves Eaton's facility but also feeds back into the local grid, reducing the burden on Puerto Rico's utility infrastructure. Following the success of the Arecibo project, Eaton is moving forward with a second microgrid at the company's Las Piedras manufacturing facility to further enhance energy resilience across the island. The need for sustainable, resilient, and cost-effective energy solutions is more pressing than ever. Projects like the Arecibo microgrid serve as a blueprint for integrating clean energy into industrial operations, benefiting both businesses and the communities they serve. As organizations increasingly electrify their operations and expand electric vehicle charging infrastructure, microgrids can often provide the necessary onsite capacity additions quickly and cost-effectively, especially when government funding and tax incentive programs are available. Successful clean energy initiatives require meticulous planning and stakeholder collaboration, including technology providers, financing partners and local utilities. There is no universal solution or "one-size-fits-all" approach for modernizing and decarbonizing energy systems. Tailored strategies that align with specific organizational goals are essential. Establishing clear operational goals and maintenance responsibilities from the outset is also critical for long-term success. Eaton focuses on clean energy projects that maximize impact, especially in regions where energy sources remain heavily reliant on fossil fuels. These initiatives not only help manage energy costs but also support the company's operational and regulatory objectives. Deployment of clean energy resources is not just a forward-thinking strategy, it is part of doing business right, providing organizations a competitive advantage. As organizations navigate an evolving energy landscape, it’s important to consider how the functionality of DERs and microgrids can help maximize the capabilities of energy systems to build the foundation for a stronger, more resilient, and more sustainable future across a company's operations. — Rich Gorze is senior global energy manager for Eaton.

But extended collapses of the power grid over the last several weeks have combined with a global hike in diesel prices to create one of the country's worst recent energy crises. Many businesses rely on diesel generators to keep the lights on when power is out, and since Ukraine's crisis doubled fuel prices in Nigeria, operating costs are sky-high.

(Photo by PIUS UTOMI EKPEI / AFP) How plausible is the target by African heads of state to grant access to electricity to 300 million people by 2030? That is the task before the over 1,000 participants expected at the Mission 300 Africa Energy Summit, which kicks off in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Jan. 27. “It’s a tight journey because 2030 is only five years away and we have to deliver, not expected connections, but actual connections to 300 million by 2030,” says Mr Daniel Schroth, African Development Bank (ADB’s) Director for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency. Schroth emphasised the urgency of implementation of Mission 300 Africa Energy Summit at a media briefing in Dar es Salaam. Mr Franz Drees-Gross, World Bank Director of Infrastructure for West Africa, said Mission 300 represented not just an ambitious target but a movement. “We are creating a lasting impact that will power Africa’s growth and enable millions of people to access the essential services electricity provides,” said Drees-Gross. The World Bank Group and the ADB launched the initiative in April 2024 to bridge the energy access gap in Africa. Mr Wale Shonibare, ADB’s Director for Energy Financial Solutions, Policy and Regulation, said the summit would unveil new initiatives aimed at boosting domestic resource mobilisation. Shonibare said it would also encourage cross-border trade to spread risk and increase financing for energy access. Related News Nigeria to lead Africa in digital economy with landmark e-governance law FG inaugurates committee for Africa tourism, creative economy expo Africa’s digital economy projected to reach $1.5tr by 2030 Already, the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP) and The Rockefeller Foundation have committed $10 million to create a technical assistance facility supporting electricity projects across 11 African nations. “What makes this initiative different from what institutions have done in the past is the ‘all hands-on deck approach’ with a lot of institutions working hand-in-hand to deliver the ambitious agenda,” explained Sarvesh Suri, IFC’s Director for Infrastructure in Africa.

Here’s how Several pilot projects aim to advance Azerbaijan’s green energy transition and serve as scalable models that other countries can also learn from. Fariz Jafarov and Ruslan Zeynalzade 26 January, 2025 01:19 pm IST Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Garadagh Solar Power Plant in Alat, Baku, Azerbaijan | Reuters/Murad Sezer Follow Us : Text Size: A- A+ A zerbaijan is positioning itself at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI) driven energy innovation, strongly focusing on integrating AI into its energy sector to improve efficiency, sustainability and grid optimization. Amid global climate goals and commitments made at the 2024 UN Climate Conference (COP29), the country is exploring key AI applications to enhance renewable energy adoption, optimize energy consumption and promote decarbonization. As well as opportunities, however, key challenges remain. Azerbaijan’s energy innovation potential Azerbaijan’s energy sector holds significant potential for innovation, driven by the strategic opportunities identified in a local stakeholder assessment run by the World Economic Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) Azerbaijan. Show Full Article One of the key opportunities includes leveraging AI to optimize energy production and distribution, improving data management and infrastructure, and enhancing energy efficiency through smart grid technologies. Collaboration between public and private sectors and partnerships with research institutions can accelerate AI integration, fostering a more sustainable and efficient energy future for Azerbaijan. Additionally, the country’s growing focus on renewable energy sources presents further avenues for AI-driven advancement. Azerbaijan could position itself as a regional leader in green energy export to Europe through cables under the Black Sea. For instance, the renewable energy company Masdar has developed the 230-megawatt-capacity Garadagh solar power plant in Azerbaijan. It has signed agreements to build a further 1 gigawatt of clean energy projects in the country. Azerbaijan benefits from favourable wind and sunlight conditions, offering significant potential for developing and deploying wind and solar energy solutions. Global innovations, local applications The AI in Energy project, an initiative with C4IR Azerbaijan, has identified several promising use cases for AI technologies within Azerbaijan’s energy sector. These include: Optimizing energy consumption through AI models Enhancing predictive maintenance for infrastructure Improving energy efficiency via AI-driven demand forecasting COP29 and subsequent climate summits are pivotal in driving this process forward. To effectively localize global solutions, these platforms allow Azerbaijan to showcase its AI-driven energy solutions, align with international sustainability goals and attract investment to accelerate green technology adoption and energy sector practices. During COP29, C4IR Azerbaijan hosted two side events on energy and sustainability. Through the centre’s work, these events showcased the potential of globally applied solutions for local impact and offered valuable insights into the initiative and its implications for sustainable energy solutions. Plans are in place to pilot and test these innovations through multistakeholder collaboration, engaging public and private sector entities, universities and research institutions. The goal is to create scalable, locally applicable solutions that can serve as regional and global adoption models. Addressing challenges to AI adoption The Azerbaijani energy industry is aware of barriers to realizing AI’s full potential. Addressing the following shortcomings could help transform the energy landscape. Cloud solutions and effective data sharing Data availability and quality, hinging on strong data governance, regulation for cloud usage and accessibility Robust legislation and infrastructure to support AI development Within this context, with the World Economic Forum’s global AI Energy Impact Initiative , C4IR Azerbaijan has shortlisted several global solutions, which could be adapted as pilot projects and localized to the country context with scalability potential. One shortlisted project involves an AI-powered energy efficiency pilot for buildings in collaboration with BrainBox, which was found to reduce energy consumption by 30%, improve carbon emissions by 25-30% and deliver a 30% return on investment. Another planned initiative is a renewable energy pilot leveraging the use case of Vestas’ predictive maintenance solution for wind turbines, aiming to replicate its proven benefits, which include reliability, optimized maintenance processes and significantly enhancing the efficiency of renewable energy infrastructure. Identified energy efficiency in buildings solution suitable for local application | Image: C4IR Azerbaijan Identified energy efficiency and clean energy solution suitable for local application | Image: C4IR Azerbaijan The potential impact of Brainbox AI and Vestas on energy optimization in Azerbaijan | Image: C4IR Azerbaijan The selected pilots will feed into broader national and global ambitions on energy sustainability, several of which were identified during COP29: Global Energy Storage and Grids Pledge Green Energy Zones and Corridors Pledge Hydrogen Declaration Realistically, meeting these pledges will require leveraging existing and emerging technologies, including AI. For instance, Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said that energy and climate goals – including tripling global renewable power capacity this decade while strengthening energy security – require countries to rapidly increase energy storage and expand and upgrade their electricity grids. Achieving this goal requires scaling up generation and overcoming the challenges associated with integrating renewables into the grids, said Francesco La Camera, director general of the International Renewable Energy Agency. Net-zero carbon cities In addition to the AI in Energy project, C4IR Azerbaijan has joined the Net Zero Carbon Cities programme of the World Economic Forum, focusing on urban development, sustainability and energy efficiency. These initiatives are now integrated into a cohesive strategy to advance energy innovation and sustainable urban transformation, leveraging AI technologies to help decarbonize urban energy systems, optimize energy usage and enhance sustainability across city infrastructure. Interviews with key local stakeholders from the public and private sectors have been conducted to identify existing challenges, potential opportunities and actionable pathways for implementation. These insights, plus outcomes from the Net Zero Carbon Cities initiative, will guide pilot implementations, with testing already underway through workshops. The Baku City Sprints, for instance, held in October 2024, brought key stakeholders from the public and private sectors together toward workably solving the urban challenges for Baku City, exploring innovative solutions and showing ways in which energy efficiency and sustainability could be advanced. The key workshop phases included: Opportunity assessment Solution prioritization Actions to take By the end, stakeholders validated city profiles, prioritized solutions and developed actionable plans tailored to the city’s context. Once executed, the AI-powered solutions developed through the Net Zero Carbon Cities initiative will be added to the Net Zero Carbon Cities Solution Toolbox . The initiative can provide valuable lessons for other countries to use AI for sustainability. It has enhanced Azerbaijan’s local expertise in AI applications for energy and urban sustainability, filling knowledge gaps, fostering collaboration between diverse stakeholders and creating new opportunities for innovation. Azerbaijan is making strides in navigating the challenges and opportunities of AI-driven energy innovation to meet critical sustainability goals. Through national and global cross-sector collaboration and localized knowledge, it has created impactful solutions that advance energy transformation and decarbonization.

Article Content:
Health care is a big business — for Boston’s lobbying shops. The sector again dominated the state lobbying firms’ focus in 2024, per records released by the Secretary of State’s office, as total lobbying spending in Massachusetts rose 5 percent to $104 million. Of the five biggest corporate spenders on lobbying, three are in health care. Again. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, the state’s largest health insurer, led the way for another year, spending $460,000. (That’s down slightly from the $495,000 that the Boston-based insurer spent on lobbying in the previous year.) Beth Israel Lahey Health and Mass General Brigham, the state’s two largest hospital chains, traded places in the rankings, with BILH spending $417,000 last year compared to MGB’s $390,000. The other biggest corporate spenders were commuter rail operator Keolis ($427,500) and simulcasting hall owner Sterling Suffolk Racecourse ($420,000). Advertisement Blue Cross spokeswoman Amy McHugh said the year was extremely busy with many health care related bills filed and debated before the end of the legislative session. In particular, she said Blue Cross lobbyists were heavily engaged with the Legislature in the drafting of a bill aimed at curbing pharmaceutical costs and another one for strengthening oversight of the state’s health care system. “Our focus during these discussions was our employer customers and members, ensuring that their voices were heard during the process, and emphasizing the need to improve health care access, quality and affordability here in Massachusetts,” McHugh said in an email. Health care and pharmaceuticals also dominated the focus of trade group lobbying. Most health insurers other than Blue Cross belong to the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans, which had the biggest lobbying spend of any business group last year, $1.3 million, compared to the runner-up, the Massachusetts Health & Hospital Association ($1.1 million). The drug industry’s local trade group, MassBio, came in third ($866,000). Advertisement And Smith, Costello & Crawford held onto the top spot among the city’s busiest lobbying firms, reporting $6.2 million in lobbying revenue, up from $5.5 million in 2023. No surprise, then, that some of the agency’s biggest clients are in health care, including Tufts Medicine, Shields Health, and UMass Memorial Health.

Home Economy Healthcare services outsourcer Omega plans to increase Philippine staffing to 5,000 Economy Editors' Picks One News By Justine Irish D. Tabile, Reporter OUTSOURCED medical services provider Omega Healthcare Management Services Private Ltd. said it is planning to increase its workforce in the Philippines to 5,000, citing growing demand for healthcare outsourcing services. Omega Healthcare Country Head Santosh Kesari told BusinessWorld that the company currently employs 2,800 professionals in the Philippines. “Omega Healthcare plans to double its workforce to 5,000 employees by 2026, reflecting confidence in the growth trajectory of the healthcare outsourcing industry,” Mr. Kesari said. “This expansion underscores the company’s commitment to leveraging the skilled Filipino workforce to deliver high-quality healthcare support services to clients worldwide,” he added. According to Mr. Santosh, the pandemic has accelerated the adoption of telehealth solutions, which has led to a shift to remote consultations and digital health management. “Several factors contribute to the rising demand for remote healthcare services, including technological advancements, patient preference for convenience, and the need for cost-effective healthcare delivery,” he said. “This trend underscores the importance of scalable, remote healthcare services to meet evolving patient needs,” he added. Challenges faced by healthcare providers are also pushing them to avail of various outsourced services. In particular, he said that healthcare providers face stringent regulatory compliance, escalating operational costs, and the imperative to enhance patient outcomes. “Outsourcing non-core functions like medical billing, coding, and revenue cycle management allows organizations to focus on patient care while ensuring compliance and operational efficiency,” he said. “Specialized outsourcing firms offer expertise in navigating complex healthcare regulations, mitigating risks, and reducing administrative burdens,” he added. Amid growing demand, he said that the Philippines’ strong pool of nursing professionals and medical coders will solidify the Philippines’ standing as a key player in global healthcare outsourcing. He cited competitive operational costs and cultural compatibility in understanding Western healthcare systems, and ability to service international clients. However, he said that healthcare providers outsourcing healthcare services in the Philippines face challenges in talent retention and data security. “High global demand for healthcare professionals can lead to attrition, necessitating continuous investment in employee engagement and development,” he said. “Ensuring compliance with international data protection standards requires robust cybersecurity measures and ongoing staff training,” he added. To support the growth of the industry, he said that the government can extend tax benefits and provide grants for technology upgrades, invest in specialized training programs, streamline compliance processes, and ensure alignment with international healthcare standards. “The future of healthcare outsourcing in the Philippines is promising, with anticipated growth in telehealth, artificial intelligence integration, and personalized medicine,” he said.

Title: A host of ways to lower Mass . health care costs
Date: 20250329T091500Z
URL: https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/29/opinion/letters-to-the-editor-tackling-mass-health-care-costs/
Source: bostonglobe.com

Article Content:
Single payer is the only solution. Everything else is a tweak. In its March 18 editorial, “Four concrete ways Mass. can lower health care costs,” the Globe offers a few areas that are “ripe for changes”: eliminating low-value care, reducing administrative waste, addressing prescription drug prices, and tackling excessive variation in what providers charge. Yet initiatives of this type have not only failed; they’ve also spawned an industry of corporate gamesmanship and harmed patients. For at least the past 10 years, efforts to raise awareness about low-value care have not succeeded in eliminating it. Meanwhile, as health care costs have continued to rise dramatically, blocking referrals for unproven procedures has resulted in a growing bureaucracy of for-profit insurance administrators making medical decisions, adding administrative expense and delaying or denying care. Pharmaceutical companies and pharmacy benefit mangers are adept at dodging regulations. For front-line providers, this creates a time-draining search — not for which medicine the patient needs but, rather, which one is covered on that particular week. Transparent pricing relies on sick people to shop for the lowest price. Can’t we do better? Advertisement With all the recent coverage of Steward Health Care and frustrated physicians organizing for better conditions, we were surprised to see no mention of a single-payer health system in the editorial. Medicare for All eliminates the waste of insurance company administrative duplication, creates a system with power to negotiate with pharmaceutical corporations, and has one mission: not profit, but health care as a human right. All developed countries have concluded this is the best solution. All have better outcomes and spend less. Dr. Barbara Ogur Cambridge Ellen Israel Jamaica Plain Ogur was a primary care physician for 46 years. Israel holds a bachelor of science in nursing and a master of public health and is a certified nurse midwife. Your editorial about how to fix the Massachusetts health care system offers a series of stopgap measures that will do little to address the fundamental problem: We have a for-profit health care system that is run by insurance companies. Our health care spending should go toward health care, not insurance companies’ bottom line. Advertisement The solution is right in front of us in the Legislature with bills to establish Medicare for All in Massachusetts. This legislation would eliminate the need for insurance companies and create a board that would set prices and consolidate billing into one agency. A moderate tax on employers and residents would fund the system and eliminate the enormous monthly premiums that employers and employees now pay. The health insurance industry is drowning our residents in medical debt and obscene monthly payments. The Legislature is terrified of this industry and its deep pockets. Until residents demand that legislators do their job and enact this legislation, we will continue to see editorials that look past the clear answer to the problem. Instead of suggesting cost cutting that could limit our access to health care, focus on slashing corporate profits. Louise Johnson Jamaica Plain Address regional needs and invest in social equity The Globe editorial board rightfully highlights the urgency of addressing skyrocketing health care costs. These costs continue to strain the budgets of individuals, families, businesses, and municipalities, not to mention the state itself, crowding out spending on other priorities and hindering the state’s affordability and competitiveness. Massachusetts’ per capita health care expenditures are among the highest in the country, yet significant gaps exist in health outcomes and access to care, especially for certain regions. Health care reform efforts must avoid exacerbating regional inequities. Savings from reducing the growth of health care spending should be redirected toward investments in primary care and upstream social determinants of health, such as transportation and housing, especially in regions that have faced chronic underinvestment. These strategic investments can build the foundation for a healthier and more resilient Commonwealth, yielding a far greater return on investment over the long term. For example, The Health Foundation of Central Massachusetts’ investment in the Quaboag Connector, a rural micro-transit service in the area around the town of Ware, has provided more than 76,000 rides since 2017. This service has enabled residents to access health care, groceries, jobs, and social activities either for free or a $2 fare per ride. The positive impact on the health and economy of the region goes beyond what investments in downstream health care could have achieved alone. Advertisement The urgency to address the state’s health care affordability challenges presents us with an opportunity to reimagine how and where we invest our limited resources to optimize health and well-being across the Commonwealth. Amie Shei President and CEO The Health Foundation of Central Massachusetts Worcester The writer holds a doctoral degree in health policy. Too many patients confuse more care with better care I read your editorial on health care costs and found a missing element: patients’ expectations. We are a country where more, quicker, and convenient is considered to be better. This is not just for online shopping; it applies to health care as well. Patients often view more care as better care, but often that is not the case. This includes the low-value testing and services your editorial seeks to see eliminated. When providers use clinical judgment, honed over decades, to recommend care without running a specific test first, this is often viewed as inferior care. At a systemic level, this contributes, for example, to redundancy in CT and MRI scans. Such services are expensive upfront, and costs need to be recouped. While I agree with the elements detailed in the editorial, I strongly believe that changing patients’ expectations about health care will be necessary to really hold down costs. Dr. Ferdinand Venditti Newburyport The writer is a retired hospital executive. Arts-based prescription reduces social isolation, yields results I read “Four concrete ways Mass. can lower health care costs” with great interest. I applaud the Globe for highlighting the need for innovative approaches that improve health outcomes while reducing costs. In that spirit, I want to add one more proven solution — one that’s already making a difference in Massachusetts. Last year, Mass Cultural Council and Art Pharmacy launched the nation’s first statewide arts prescription initiative, known as arts-based social prescribing. This practice connects patients to community-based arts and cultural activities to improve overall health. It has been shown to support mental health, reduce social isolation and loneliness, and improve adherence to treatment plans, all at a fraction of the cost of traditional medical interventions. Advertisement Though unconventional, social prescribing is backed by strong evidence and economic benefits. In Canada, for example, data show every dollar invested in social prescribing yields an estimated return of $4.43. Social isolation is linked to anxiety and depression. Addressing these challenges requires creative solutions, and Massachusetts’ cultural sector is ready to help. We believe in the power of culture and know that innovation thrives through creativity. Michael J. Bobbitt Executive director Mass Cultural Council Boston The Mass Cultural Council is the Commonwealth’s arts agency.

Article Insights Parsons Behle & Latimer are most popular: within Tax topic(s) with readers working within the Advertising & Public Relations and Construction & Engineering industries The Health and Human Service Office of the Inspector General (OIG) exists to detect and remedy fraud, waste and abuse in the healthcare industry. Last year, Medicaid Fraud Control Units recovered $1.4 billion from healthcare industry members for alleged fraud and abuse. The majority of the OIG's resources go towards the oversight of Medicare and Medicaid — programs that represent a significant part of the federal budget and that serve some of the country's most vulnerable citizens. The OIG regularly oversees audits of healthcare providers. This includes audits of hospitals, practice groups, individual practitioners, pharmacies, home health agencies and other healthcare industry members and providers. These audits are typically conducted to determine whether a healthcare provider was overpaid by The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) or if they committed Medicare fraud. The OIG's oversight extends to other arenas as well. The OIG may pursue punitive measures for actions such as failing to evaluate and stabilize an emergency patient, abuse/neglect in nursing homes, HIPAA violations, Anti-Kickback and Stark law violations and medical identity theft. The OIG can also "exclude" individuals from participating in the Medicare program for having had a criminal conviction or discipline to their medical license, among other things. Providers can also render themselves and their practices ineligible to receive Medicare reimbursement if they hire individuals who have been excluded by the OIG. The prohibition for hiring excluded individuals includes medical assistants, receptionists, nurses, etc. or healthcare providers. What will subject a healthcare provider to an audit ? Many healthcare audits are random. However, the OIG may also look for "red flags" to conduct an audit, such as providers that seek high-dollar reimbursement amounts for a small number of patients; data analysis of medical records that reveal billing errors or unusual trends; or whistleblower reports. Providers who are statistical outliers from their peers are at higher risk of an audit. What steps can healthcare providers take to prevent an audit ? The OIG has set forth guidelines to help healthcare providers comply with relevant federal law. The most recent comprehensive guide was published in November 2023. This guide is generally applicable to all healthcare providers. Some of the relevant takeaways from this guide include: Healthcare providers must monitor their business activities for potential violations of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and Physician Self-Referral (aka Stark) laws. Key steps that providers can take include avoiding improper inducements to either provide or receive referrals and making sure all healthcare transactions are billed at fair market value. Develop a policy to comply with the recently enacted Information Blocking Act. This law requires healthcare providers to refrain from engaging in a practice that is likely to interfere with, prevent or materially discourage the access, exchange or use of electronic health information. Penalties for violating this act may include Civil Monetary Penalties (CMPs) of up to $1 million per violation. Regularly review the OIG's exclusion list to ensure that potential healthcare employees are not on the list. The OIG has the legal authority to impose CMPs on individual and entity employers that arrange or contract (by employment or otherwise) with an individual or entity whom the employer knows or should know is excluded from participation in a federal health care program. Develop and implement a policy to ensure that all record-keeping and billing practices are compliant with current CMS standards, including compliance with Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs). Assess your practice's risk level for potential Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) violations. The OIG anticipates publishing additional specific guidelines for hospitals, Medicare advantage providers and clinical laboratories in 2025. Healthcare providers can also sign up to receive notices of OIG exclusion updates here . In November 2024, CMS finalized the 2025 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, bringing a 2.83% across-the-board cut to physician reimbursement. The reduction immediately triggered concerns throughout the medical community, with many healthcare organizations pushing for Congressional intervention. Although there was optimism that Congress would act in late 2024 to avert or soften the cut, those efforts ultimately failed. Healthcare providers should therefore continue to be cautious about their submissions for reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid programs. CMS and Congress have made their intentions to cut costs clear, yet healthcare providers can prepare for a potential audit or CMS action by proactively implementing the above guidelines from the OIG. The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances. Authors Chelsea Hintze J. Kevin West

Leaders from the Emory WHSC Office of Well-Being (L to R) Dhaval Desai, Krystyna Morgan and Evan Thoman in Washington, DC for the Health Workforce Well-Being Day. On March 11, 2020, after more than 118,000 diagnoses in 114 countries and 4,291 deaths, the World Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Few could have foreseen the long-term impacts the pandemic would have on the physical and mental wellness of the nation’s health workforce. As the world observed the fifth anniversary of the COVID-19 pandemic earlier this month, a group of health care professionals from across the country convened in Washington, DC to advocate for health care workers’ well-being and mental health. On March 18, the Healthcare Leadership Collaborative brought together leaders and professionals from across the nation for a series of insightful sessions, workshops and discussions aimed at fostering a culture of support and trust within health care organizations. Organized by Johns Hopkins in partnership with the Dr. Lorna Breen Heroes Foundation, the event coincided with the National Academy of Medicine’s annual Health Workforce Well-Being (HWWB) Day. Emory representatives at the event included Evan Thoman, Emory’s Chief Well-Being Officer, Dhaval Desai, MD, hospital medicine physician and the co-lead of the EmWELL Physicians Workgroup, and Krystyna Morgan, EmWELL’s director. HWWB Day is an annual event marking the date the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act was signed into law in 2022. Named after Dr. Lorna Breen, an emergency medicine physician who tragically died by suicide during the peak of the first COVID-19 surge, the act provides federal funding for mental health education, awareness campaigns and resources to support the well-being of health care workers. Key themes of this year’s event included transforming the culture of health care and medicine through listening, storytelling and authentic leadership. "Our participation in this summit underscores Emory's commitment to fostering a culture of well-being," says Thoman. “As leaders, we must be intentional in our efforts to create environments where our team members feel that their well-being is protected and supported." Keynote speaker Michael C. Bush, CEO of Great Place To Work ® , highlighted the role of trust in exceptional workplaces and encouraged health care leaders to embrace change to attract top talent and achieve long-term success. Other panelists and guest speakers presented on topics including leading culture transformation, creating systems where health care workers thrive, improving listening skills to enhance leadership effectiveness and interpersonal interactions, and the power of storytelling in building connections and supporting effective advocacy. "As health care providers, our well-being directly impacts patient care,” says Desai, who also serves as the ambassador for the Dr. Lorna Breen Heroes Foundation. “This summit has reinforced the importance of empathy and honest communication in our daily practice."

For years, the Hinduja family has been a stalwart in nation-building, social responsibility, and philanthropy. Their commitment to delivering the best medical care is above and beyond any business interest; therefore, the healthcare sector is one area in which they have excelled. Prakash Hinduja supports universal access to high-quality healthcare irrespective of financial situation Prakash Hinduja, Managing Trustee of the Hinduja Foundation, has been a steadfast supporter of universal access to high-quality healthcare, irrespective of financial situation. The Hinduja family's healthcare vision is influencing the direction of medical services in India through the founding and ongoing funding of the hospitals in Bangalore and Mumbai. A Legacy Rooted in Service Their forays into the health sector were based on the principle of the Hinduja family's founder, Parmanand Deepchand Hinduja: "Work to give." Such was the concept behind the P. D. Hinduja National Hospital & Medical Research Centre. This not-for-profit venture aspires to provide leading-edge medical care while still maintaining a humanitarian nature. Over the years, the hospital has grown into a premier institution known for its excellent medical treatment, research capabilities, and patient-centered philosophy. The Hinduja family is also supporting a charity hospital in Bangalore as part of their healthcare mission after seeing the urgent need for high-quality care outside of Mumbai. These institutions are more than just medical centres—they are symbols of commitment to improving the well-being of Indian society by delivering top-tier healthcare services to all segments of the population. Prakash Hinduja on the Importance of Accessible Healthcare Prakash Hinduja firmly believes that world-class healthcare should not be a privilege but a fundamental right. He highlights that the foundation of an effective healthcare system must be excellence, affordability, and accessibility. "Healthcare is about giving people the tools they need to live better, more satisfying lives, not only about curing diseases. Through our hospitals, we are committed to ensuring that financial constraints do not hinder anyone from receiving quality medical treatment,” he says. P. D. Hinduja Hospitals: A Benchmark for Medical Excellence The P. D. Hinduja Hospitals in Mumbai and Bangalore are known for their highly qualified staff, state-of-the-art medical facilities, and specialty treatment. These institutions offer cardiology, cancer, neurology, orthopedics, and other medical specialties which makes them among the best hospitals in the nation because of their dedication to research and innovation, which promotes advances in medical science while upholding a strong patient-first philosophy. These hospitals prioritize community health awareness, early diagnosis, and preventative healthcare in addition to treatment. Their goal of creating a healthier India is mostly dependent on initiatives like vaccination drives, public health awareness campaigns, and free health check-up camps. A Focus on Preventive Healthcare A Focus on Preventive Healthcare Prakash Hinduja is constantly highlighting the importance of preventive healthcare that will alleviate the burden on India’s medical infrastructure. “We must shift our focus from reactive to preventive healthcare. Our hospitals are actively engaged in promoting early detection of diseases, lifestyle management, and wellness programs that encourage people to take charge of their health before complications arise,” he explains. The P. D. Hinduja Hospitals, owned and managed by the Hindujas, are trying to incorporate preventative healthcare practices into standard medical practice by partnering with international medical organizations, NGOs, and government agencies. Initiatives like regular tests for chronic illnesses, mental health awareness campaigns, and the encouragement of sustainable lifestyle choices are examples of this. A Vision for the Future The hospitals are constantly changing to satisfy the needs of contemporary healthcare under the direction of the Hindujas. In order to reach rural places, future plans call for improving digital healthcare solutions, integrating AI-driven diagnostics, and growing telemedicine services. Prakash Hinduja envisions a future where healthcare is not only more accessible but also more personalized, ensuring that every patient receives care tailored to their specific needs. With an unwavering dedication to social responsibility, the Hinduja family’s healthcare initiatives stand as a testament to the power of philanthropy in driving positive change. Their hospitals are not just medical institutions; they are beacons of hope, offering healing, support, and a vision for a healthier, more equitable future. Prakash Hinduja and his family have been strong advocates for health care. Part of the Hindujas' overall mission is to uplift society through meaningful, impactful initiatives. Prioritizing medical excellence, affordability, and preventive healthcare, P. D. Hinduja Hospitals continue to raise the bar for patient care. With the ever-changing healthcare scene in India, the Hinduja family legacy gives hope for the future. The legacies proven to be possible with dedication, vision, and compassion are world -class medical care, accessible to all.

63,000 public healthcare staff to get salary jumps of up to 7% Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox The Health Ministry said healthcare staff will continue to receive annual pay increments to keep salaries in pace with inflation. PHOTO: ST FILE Lee Li Ying Follow topic: Healthcare Published Mar 27, 2025, 03:42 PM Updated Mar 27, 2025, 11:54 PM SINGAPORE – Some 63,000 healthcare professionals in the public sector will get an increase of up to 7 per cent on their monthly base salaries from July 1 as the sector strives to better attract and retain staff. Specifically, 37,000 allied healthcare professionals (AHPs), pharmacists, and administrative, ancillary and support staff will get the maximum salary increase of up to 7 per cent. The last salary increase for this group of healthcare professionals was in 2021. Another group of 26,000 public healthcare nurses will also have their monthly base salaries bumped up, but the cap is at 4 per cent. The adjustments are on top of the Award for Nurses’ Grace, Excellence and Loyalty (Angel) scheme launched in September 2024 to attract and encourage nurses to build a lifelong career in nursing. The Angel scheme will see about 29,000 nurses receiving up to $100,000 each in payouts over a 20-year period. “With these salary increases, which are over and above the annual increments, we will enable the public healthcare sector to better attract and retain staff,” the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a statement on March 27. The ministry said that healthcare staff will continue to receive annual pay increments, aimed at keeping salaries in pace with inflation. It added that healthcare workers are the driving force behind good care, and salary reviews are conducted regularly to ensure pay remains competitive. “Beyond remuneration, we will continue to review our manpower development initiatives and improve opportunities for our healthcare workers through job redesign and career development,” said MOH. Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung had in January announced the pay increase for the 37,000 allied healthcare professionals (AHPs), pharmacists, and administrative, ancillary and support staff. The pay adjustments come amid rising demand in Singapore for healthcare workers, who will be attending to a greying population. Nurses form the biggest group of professionals within Singapore’s healthcare system. But global competition for nurses intensified following the Covid-19 pandemic, especially after the borders started to reopen in 2021. Among local nurses, the attrition rate was 7.4 per cent in 2021, up from 5.4 per cent in 2020. For foreign nurses, attrition more than doubled year on year to 14.8 per cent in 2021. AHPs are also key healthcare workers here. They include physiotherapists, dietitians, occupational therapists and medical social workers – all of whom work alongside doctors and nurses in hospitals to support patients. The proportion of AHPs who left the public healthcare sector rose from 8.9 per cent in 2018 to 11.6 per cent in 2022. Singapore is planning to unveil a strategy later in 2025 that will better carve out the roles AHPs will play in the healthcare sector. Dr Tan Wu Meng, chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health, said that increasing their salaries by up to 7 per cent is an important first step in attracting and retaining talent. However, more needs to be done to raise public awareness of the importance of AHPs in healthcare, said Dr Tan, who is also an oncologist at the National Cancer Centre. For instance, caregivers of elderly patients need not quit their jobs if a physiotherapist can help the seniors regain mobility. “That kind of value is very important, and there is room to recognise that better,” said Dr Tan. Professor Tan Bhing Leet, cluster director of health and social sciences at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), said there is also a need to enhance career development opportunities for AHPs. SIT, for one, has been working closely with MOH to provide the necessary clinical and professional training for AHPs to advance in their jobs. Professor Liaw Sok Ying, head of the Alice Lee Centre for Nursing Studies at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, hopes that the higher salaries for nurses will attract more school-leavers to pursue nursing as a career. “Given the global demand for nurses, it is inevitable that many of our nursing graduates will be attracted to opportunities abroad. This salary increase will not only improve the local job market for nurses, but also highlight that nursing provides competitive pay and opportunities for a global career,” said Prof Liaw. In a statement, Healthcare Services Employees’ Union president K. Thanaletchimi thanked the three public healthcare clusters for their close collaboration to improve the wages of public healthcare workers. Besides salary rises, other good outcomes like increases in salary ranges, as well as improved medical, dental and hospitalisation benefits, were also achieved, she said. “Our healthcare workers are dedicated in their care for us. By recognising their dedication with wages and benefits that are both fair and competitive, we are reinforcing our commitment to their well-being. These enhancements will enable Singapore to continue attracting and retaining top talent, while strengthening our public healthcare system for the future,” said Ms Thanaletchimi.

Minneapolis Hennepin Healthcare System CEO to step down Jennifer DeCubellis is credited with leading the health care system through the COVID-19 pandemic and civil unrest in Minneapolis. By Elliot Hughes The Minnesota Star Tribune March 27, 2025 at 2:42AM Jennifer DeCubellis, pictured in 2017 while serving as deputy county administrator for Hennepin County, is stepping down as the leader of the Hennepin Healthcare System. (The Minnesota Star Tribune) Comment Gift Share Listen Jennifer DeCubellis, the chief executive of Hennepin Healthcare System, announced Wednesday she will step down from her role in May. Hennepin Healthcare System operates HCMC in downtown Minneapolis and other clinics in the county. “Every leader has a season,” DeCubellis said in a statement. “We are all destined for a specific purpose, and a strong leader passes the baton when the time is right. That time for me is now.” The health care system, which is the state’s largest safety-net hospital for vulnerable populations, credited DeCubellis with leading it through the COVID-19 pandemic and civil unrest that rocked the Twin Cities in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd. “We are grateful for Jennifer’s leadership over the past five years,” Hennepin Healthcare Board Chair Mohamed Omar said in a statement. “She has gone above and beyond for the organization during the most challenging period in healthcare in the last century.” The board will announce an interim CEO on Thursday and will launch a national search for a permanent successor. DeCubellis assumed the chief executive role two weeks before Minnesota’s first COVID-19 case in 2020 . Under her leadership, the health care system prioritized patient access to lifesaving care, promoted the safety of staff members and secured support from the National Guard. DeCubellis was also credited with improving staff retention. The health care system has a multi-year $2.5 billion overhaul planned for HCMC that includes plans to build a new 450-bed inpatient tower .

TAMPA, FLORIDA / ACCESS Newswire / March 26, 2025 / Black Book Market Research LLC, a leading independent healthcare IT survey and polling organization, today released the results of its annual 2025 Patient Engagement and Healthcare Consumer Communication Technologies Survey. The nationwide study, conducted over a six-month period, captured insights from 2,518 verified users, including clinical, administrative, and IT professionals across the care continuum, as well as more than 1,000 healthcare consumers. In the 2025 report, InteliChart received the highest client experience ratings across 14 of 18 key performance indicators (KPIs), earning the #1 overall ranking among end-to-end patient engagement solution vendors for the third consecutive year. The survey results reflect input from: 1,511 provider-side users representing 1,444 hospitals, health systems, ambulatory centers, physician groups, and long-term care organizations 1,007 patients and healthcare consumers offering firsthand feedback on their experience with provider engagement tools 188 independent EHR and healthcare IT implementation consultants from vendor-neutral firms with direct technical and operational expertise The 2025 evaluation introduced an updated KPI framework, developed in collaboration with healthcare CIOs, HIT consultants, and academic leaders in digital health. These newly defined indicators replace outdated general performance metrics, offering more targeted and meaningful assessments in areas such as interoperability, automation, patient usability, platform scalability, and clinical communication outcomes. Participants evaluated 25 patient engagement vendors based on this refined set of KPIs, including categories such as User-Friendliness, Customization Capabilities, Integration Efficiency, Communication Effectiveness, Data Security, Cost-Effectiveness, Future-Proofing, and Operational Impact. "The healthcare industry is undergoing a major transformation in how it approaches patient engagement. What were once peripheral tools are now mission-critical technologies enabling accessible, coordinated, and highly personalized care," said Doug Brown, Founder of Black Book Research. "Next-generation platforms-powered by AI-driven communication, mobile-first design, predictive analytics, and intelligent automation-are fundamentally changing how patients connect with their providers and manage their health." "As healthcare shifts toward value-based care, and interoperability frameworks like FHIR mature, organizations need engagement solutions that not only meet rising consumer expectations but also integrate seamlessly across ecosystems to support real-time data exchange and population health strategies. While EHR-native tools offer foundational features, providers are increasingly adopting best-of-breed platforms that deliver greater agility, deeper functionality, and retail-grade digital experiences across every patient touchpoint," said Brown. The InteliChart platform received top recognition for its comprehensive, fully integrated suite of patient engagement tools, including digital intake workflows, self-scheduling, AI-powered outreach, secure messaging, virtual care, population health capabilities, and intuitive patient portals-all delivered through a seamlessly unified, EHR-integrated architecture. Survey participants consistently cited InteliChart's ability to streamline engagement workflows, enhance communication, and support scalable, real-time digital interactions across the healthcare ecosystem. The Black Book methodology is built on a rigorous, crowdsourced polling process using a double-blind format to ensure impartiality and accuracy. All rankings are independently produced, with no vendor involvement in funding or influence, and are based solely on validated end-user feedback. As patient engagement becomes a cornerstone of digital health strategy, healthcare organizations are increasingly prioritizing platforms that enable secure, accessible, and consumer-centered experiences. The 2025 survey results reflect a rapidly evolving market, where leading vendors are reshaping how healthcare is delivered, experienced, and sustained-across both provider operations and patient lives.

Title: Study examines trends tied to surge in health care jobs
Date: 20250326T173000Z
URL: https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/03/siepr-study-health-care-job-growth-neale-mahoney

Article Content:
Careers in health care have long been seen as sure bets, especially given growing numbers of older Americans. There’s fresh evidence, courtesy of Stanford economist Neale Mahoney, for just how much those jobs are paying off. For instance, earnings for U.S. health care workers as a group have risen almost twice as fast as those in other industries, based on data spanning more than four decades. In 2009, the American health care sector overtook retail as the country’s largest source of jobs. Here’s another revelation from the new working paper by Mahoney, the Trione Director at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR) and economics professor in the Stanford School of Humanities and Sciences: Despite talk of U.S. cities hard hit by manufacturing declines pivoting to health care to boost local employment, Mahoney and his co-authors find that it’s not happening as hoped. Health care jobs have only slightly offset job losses in manufacturing – and not at all among workers who aren’t white and for those lacking college degrees. Other takeaways from the study of U.S. Census data from 1980 to 2022: Wage hikes in health care haven’t benefited workers equally. The big winners relative to the rest of the U.S. labor force have been middle-class and upper-middle class health care employees. Compensation for nurses, for example, have risen approximately 82%, compared to nearly 37% for all U.S. workers. Physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other so-called “midlevels” provide more than half of primary care services in the U.S. Since 2010 – when the job category became large enough to track consistently – the number of midlevel positions has more than doubled. There are now more midlevels than primary care doctors in the U.S. About three-quarters of health care jobs are held by women, a level unchanged since 1980. What’s different now is that there are three times as many female physicians than there were four decades ago (though male doctors remain the majority). The share of males who work as nurses and aides has also increased. The proportion of physicians and aides born outside the U.S. has grown at a faster rate than it has for foreign-born workers generally. The share of foreign-born nurses and midlevels, meanwhile, has grown at smaller rates than the economy-wide average. Overall, Mahoney and his collaborators – Joshua Gottlieb of the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy; Kevin Rinz of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, and Victoria Udalova of the U.S. Census Bureau – say the study findings have important policy implications. Health care, the study authors write, has been one of the largest trends in the U.S. labor market in a generation – and a “modern middle-class ‘jobs engine.’” Why that engine hasn’t reached economies hit hard by manufacturing’s decline, the researchers say, could be because “manufacturing-to-meds” policy proposals haven’t received the necessary resources or, if they did, they have not produced the desired results. “Now that we have a clearer reading on what’s happening in the health care job market,” Mahoney says, “understanding what’s behind the trends will be crucial as the industry continues to expand and technology changes.” For more information This story was originally published by the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research.

Generate Key Takeaways Gov. Ron DeSantis signs the "Live Healthy" bill package on March 21, 2024. (Screenshot/Florida Channel) A House budget committee wants to slash a 10-year, $500 million health innovation loan program and a 15-member council charged with recommending how to spend the money. The House Health Care Budget Committee released a 12- page proposed budget conforming bill late Monday night, in advance of releasing its proposed health care spending blueprint for state fiscal year 2024-25. The bill makes additional conforming changes to the state Medicaid program meant to help implement the proposed health care budget. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Specifically, PCB HC 25-01 eliminates a recently-enacted law championed by Sen. Gayle Harrell that was considered part of former Senate President Kathleen Passidomo’s “Live Healthy” initiative , a multi-pronged approach to bolstering the state’s health care workforce and infrastructure to provide for an aging population. Passed in 2024, Harrell’s SB 7018 created the 10-year revolving loan program within the Florida Department of Health (DOH). The law directs the state’s chief financial officer to appropriate $50 million to the DOH annually to fund the loan program, meaning the program would receive $500 million in state funds over its lifetime. Sen. Gayle Harrell (Photo via the Florida Senate.) Harrell told the Florida Phoenix Tuesday that she was surprised by the move and was “not happy.” “I’m seriously concerned about it. I don’t think it is appropriate to do that. We just passed it last year. It’s going to take several years for the Innovation Council to be up and running. We’re just starting to get the first look at the kinds of things that are really going to change the state.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement When asked if she thought it was being eliminated because of the hefty state commitment Harrell replied: “It’s an investment, and it’s going to change the direction of health care through innovation.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX The goal was to provide low-interest loans to applicants to implement one or more innovative technologies, workforce pathways, or service delivery models that: Increase efficiency in the delivery of health care; Reduce the strain on the health care workforce; Increase public access to health care; Improve patient outcomes; Reduce unnecessary emergency department visits; Reduce costs for patients and the state without reducing the quality of patient care.

The House budget conforming bill also makes changes to the Casey DeSantis Casey DeSantis Cancer Research Program, requiring it to consider specialty hospitals for children when awarding cancer research grants. The proposed budget bill doesn’t make the broad changes to cancer funding t hat the DeSantis administration has called for . While Harrell says she’s “seriously concerned” about the proposal, Passidomo is not. Sen. Kathleen Passidomo (Photo via the Florida Senate) “It’s not set in stone and I’m not really involved in the budget process right now,” Passidomo, chair of the powerful Senate Rules Committee, told the Florida Phoenix Tuesday evening. “I think it’s all part of the process.

Kenya’s healthcare system is in dire straits. Public hospitals are struggling, medical professionals are frustrated, and patients are bearing the brunt of systemic failures. Education is Your Right!

Source: Getty Images Yet, amidst the chaos, a golden opportunity exists - one that we are woefully underutilising. The country has doctors and clinical doctors who have transitioned into law, professionals uniquely positioned to tackle the legal and administrative bottlenecks strangling our healthcare sector. Why, then, are we failing to tap into this expertise? Maroa Rioba, a clinical medicine graduate and advocate, shares her opinion on the issue. Having walked the wards as a clinician and now argued cases in court as an advocate, I have seen the failures of both systems up close. PAY ATTENTION: TUKO is in WhatsApp Channels now! Subscribe and read news in favourite messenger. The problems facing healthcare in Kenya are not just about a lack of medicine or personnel; they are deeply rooted in poor governance, weak legal frameworks, and a lack of accountability. Read also Reviving Moi University: 5 strategies to restore lost Glory of Eldoret-based premier institution If we are serious about reform, we must stop treating symptoms and start curing the disease at its root. Healthcare on life support The problems in our healthcare sector are well documented. Public hospitals are underfunded, medical staff are overworked and underpaid, and corruption remains rampant. Meanwhile, doctors and nurses frequently engage in industrial strikes over poor working conditions, while patients, especially in rural areas, face devastating medical negligence with little legal recourse. The law, which should provide solutions, often does the opposite. Medical malpractice claims take years to resolve, healthcare professionals are prosecuted without proper legal defense, and policies affecting the sector are drafted by people who have never set foot in a hospital’s emergency room. It is absurd. We need legal minds that understand medicine—those who have stitched wounds, diagnosed illnesses, and dealt with the ethical dilemmas of medical practice—to guide these decisions. Why medical-legal professionals are the missing link An old African proverb says, “A chick that will grow into a rooster can be spotted the very day it hatches.” Read also Gen Z's unyielding voice: A new political challenge for William Ruto Similarly, the solution to our healthcare crisis has been in plain sight all along—medical professionals who have ventured into law. These individuals can provide practical, experience-driven legal guidance in several key areas: i) Fixing weak healthcare policies Many of our healthcare laws are outdated or ambiguous, leaving room for misinterpretation and mismanagement. A medical advocate understands both the letter of the law and the realities of medical practice, making them the best candidates to draft, amend, and interpret policies that work. ii) Defending Medical Practitioners The rising number of medical professionals facing criminal prosecution for medical errors is alarming. While accountability is necessary, we must differentiate between negligence and unfortunate medical outcomes. A lawyer with medical training can argue these cases with the nuance they deserve, preventing unjust convictions while ensuring genuine malpractice is addressed. iii) Protecting Patient Rights Many Kenyans suffer in silence after receiving poor medical care, either because they do not know their rights or because they lack the resources to pursue legal action. Medico-legal professionals can play a key role in advocating for these patients, ensuring that hospitals uphold ethical standards and deliver quality care. Read also Moi University sacks over 300 workers, cites operational costs: “Hatujafurahia” iv) Mediating Healthcare Disputes Legal battles between healthcare workers and government institutions often drag on for years, leaving hospitals in limbo and patients suffering. Instead of endless court cases, why not have specialized medical-law tribunals where disputes can be resolved quickly and fairly? v) Strengthening Hospital Governance Public hospitals continue to bleed funds through corruption and mismanagement. Having medical-legal experts in hospital boards and government health agencies can help close these loopholes, ensuring transparency and proper accountability in the allocation of resources. What is way forward for Kenyan health workers? It is time to rethink how we approach healthcare governance. We have trained professionals who understand both the complexities of medicine and the intricacies of the law. Why aren’t we giving them a seat at the decision-making table? The government should: Establish medical-legal advisory boards to provide expert guidance on healthcare legislation and dispute resolution. Appoint medical advocates to hospital management boards and regulatory bodies.

We can either continue on this path of inefficiency and legal chaos, or we can embrace the expertise of those who understand both medicine and law to bring about real change. The choice is clear. If we truly care about saving lives and ensuring justice, we must start utilizing medical-legal professionals to fix the broken system.

Article Content:
iStock The Delhi government on Tuesday allocated Rs 12,893 crore for the health sector in the 2025-26 budget to support flagship schemes like Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, set up two new medical colleges, and add 16,186 beds in government hospitals. Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta presented the 2025-26 budget in the Assembly, announcing a significant push to strengthen the capital's healthcare infrastructure. A major portion of the budget will support flagship schemes like Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY), aimed at providing financial protection and affordable healthcare to more families in the capital. In her budget speech, Gupta said the government is committed to transforming Delhi's healthcare system by strengthening critical care services, expanding primary healthcare facilities, and modernizing medical infrastructure. "Our goal is to ensure no one is left behind when it comes to quality healthcare," she added. The budget earmarks Rs 1,666.66 crore under the Pradhan Mantri - Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission (PM-ABHIM) to boost critical care blocks and diagnostics, alongside Rs 320 crore for setting up 400 Health and Wellness Centres (HWC), also known as Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM). Live Events Additionally, Rs 9.92 crore has been allocated for the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission, aiming to digitize patient records and improve accessibility to healthcare services. With a total outlay of Rs 12,893 crore for the health sector - including Rs 3,421 crore for capital projects - Gupta said the government is determined to make Delhi a hub of quality healthcare and medical education. The government has also allocated Rs 147.64 crore to expand financial protection under the Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY), ensuring more families benefit from free, cashless treatment for serious illnesses. "We are determined to transform Delhi's healthcare system with sustainable reforms, modern infrastructure, and digital innovation. Every citizen - rich or poor, young or old - deserves access to affordable, high-quality healthcare," Gupta said. She also announced that two new medical colleges will be established in Delhi to improve healthcare services and boost medical education. "This will provide high-quality medical education to Delhi's youth and create new employment opportunities in the healthcare sector," she said, adding that the previous AAP government "never took strong steps" in the health sector. "It is our aim to make Delhi a hub of health and education, and this initiative will give our youth an opportunity to excel in the medical field," Gupta added. Highlighting the current shortfall in hospital beds, Gupta cited World Health Organization (WHO) norms, which recommend 5 beds per 1,000 people. "At present, Delhi has only 2.7 beds per 1,000 people--far below the required standard. This is why patients face long queues for OPD services, medicine, and diagnostic tests. The shortage of doctors, nurses, and paramedical staff, combined with limited radiology facilities like CT scans, MRIs, and PET-CTs, further strains the system," she said. To address this, the government plans to complete 24 pending hospital projects, including 7 ICU hospitals, 4 new hospitals, and the expansion of 13 existing facilities. Once completed, these projects are expected to add 16,186 new beds to Delhi's public healthcare system. Promoting holistic healthcare, Gupta announced the establishment of the Delhi State AYUSH Society (DSAS) to encourage alternative medicine systems like Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy. The total budget outlay for the health sector stands at Rs 10,295 crore, including Rs 3,421 crore for capital projects and Rs 6,874 crore for various health schemes, programs, and infrastructure development. "Our goal is to provide accessible, affordable, and high-quality healthcare to every citizen of Delhi - whether rich or poor, young or old," Gupta said, emphasising that sustainable reforms and modern infrastructure will pave the way for a healthier, more resilient capital. Presenting the Rs One lakh crore budget - a 31.5 per cent increase from the previous year - Gupta said the government is committed to ensuring quality healthcare for all. Criticising the previous administration's performance, she claimed it "failed to provide basic healthcare facilities." The last government started 24 projects that ended up being of no use. Our goal is to make Delhi's health system stronger and more accessible to all, she said. The Chief Minister also announced plans to fast-track the construction of 10 to 13 new hospitals, with Rs 1,000 crore allocated specifically for the initiative. "We are determined to build a robust, modern healthcare system for Delhi - one that serves everyone efficiently," Gupta added. This is the first budget presented by a BJP-led government in Delhi in over 26 years, following the party's victory over the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in last month's Assembly elections.

This 130-page resource is offered gratis to industry stakeholders, providing extensive insights, strategic analysis, customer and patient feedback, and 200+ detailed vendor profiles to support informed decision-making. This year's edition offers an unprecedented look at patient engagement solutions, ranging from end-to-end comprehensive platforms to specialized niche, EHR-agnostic applications. The guide explores cutting-edge trends including AI-driven automation, predictive analytics, omnichannel communication, enhanced interoperability, cybersecurity innovations, and the surge in personalized healthcare engagement tools. It may be download without cost at https://blackbookmarketresearch.com/2025-black-book-of-patient-engagement-and-healthcare-consumer-communications-technology. Key findings reveal that 85% of healthcare organizations are now investing in AI-powered patient engagement technologies, while 78% of consumers prefer digital communication channels. Additionally, 43% of health systems plan to transition away from legacy engagement platforms by Q3 2026, signaling a significant shift towards advanced, integrated solutions. Doug Brown, founder of Black Book Research, emphasized, "Patient engagement technology is rapidly evolving into an essential component of healthcare delivery. Our 2025 report underscores that healthcare organizations that strategically integrate AI, interoperability frameworks, and secure, consumer-focused solutions will be best positioned to enhance patient outcomes and improve operational efficiency in an increasingly digital healthcare environment." Comprehensive Vendor Profiles and Market Insights The guide includes detailed profiles of 224 vendors across 14 solution and niche categories, providing clarity on the strengths and market positioning of industry-leading providers. These profiles highlight solutions tailored to various healthcare settings including hospitals, health systems, payers, and physician practices, enabling informed comparisons and strategic decisions. New Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Focused on Emerging Technologies Traditional performance metrics - such as Net Promoter Scores (NPS) and generic online satisfaction ratings - have long been used to assess healthcare IT vendors, but in the realm of Patient Engagement and Healthcare Consumer Communication Technologies, these measures have proven inadequate. They fail to capture the complexity of digital patient interactions, interoperability effectiveness, AI-driven personalization, and secure data exchange. As a result, healthcare IT leaders have often lacked the nuanced, actionable insights needed to make informed vendor decisions - limiting innovation and overlooking truly high-performing solutions. To solve this, Black Book led an extensive, multi-stakeholder initiative involving CIOs, vendor executives, academic researchers, and digital health leaders to develop a new, purpose-built set of KPIs specifically for this rapidly advancing sector. These new metrics account for technological innovation, including AI-powered engagement, FHIR-based interoperability, cybersecurity resilience, and patient-centered communication outcomes. The 2025 guide now applies this rigorous framework to identify top-performing vendors with real-world impact - empowering decision-makers to move beyond outdated benchmarks and adopt solutions that truly enhance patient experience, care delivery, and digital transformation outcomes. In-Depth Coverage of AI, Cybersecurity and Interoperability Trends The report provides extensive analysis of AI integration in patient communication, showing administrative workload reductions of up to 60% through chatbot adoption and increased patient adherence rates by as much as 38%. It also addresses the critical issue of cybersecurity, noting a 42% rise in cyberattacks on healthcare organizations, underscoring the urgency for blockchain-based patient identity solutions and biometric security advancements. Additionally, the document explores interoperability trends with over 90% of major healthcare organizations projected to implement FHIR-based APIs by 2027, significantly reducing manual errors and improving care coordination. Analytics and Data Science in Patient Engagement Newly featured analytics and data science sections emphasize the growing role of predictive analytics in patient engagement. Organizations leveraging these advanced tools report a 30% reduction in patient no-shows and a 24% decrease in preventable ER visits, demonstrating the clear financial and clinical benefits of data-driven patient engagement strategies.

Title: Opinion | Health care has a problem . Trump is making it worse .

URL: https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/25/opinion/last-mile-health-services-research-ahrq/

Article Content:
Dr. Jeffrey L. Schnipper is a hospitalist and health services researcher in the Boston area. There is a “last mile” problem in health care. The United States spends billions of dollars on basic science research, drug development, and clinical trials, but after that, it leaves it up to the health care system to make sure that effective treatments get in the hands of patients who need them. It can take 17 years for research evidence to make it into routine clinical practice. In the meantime, patients needlessly suffer. Moreover, it is a waste of those billions of dollars spent on medical research. As an example, despite the known effectiveness of medications such as buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder, only a quarter of patients who need such medications receive them. Advertisement There is, however, one branch of science dedicated to solving the last mile problem in health care. It is called health services research , and it examines and seeks to improve the effectiveness of health care delivery, i.e., the extent to which it provides care based on the best evidence available. It also seeks to improve the quality of health care delivery in other ways, making sure it is safe, efficient, equitable, timely, and patient-centered . The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, is the federal agency that funds health services research, but the Trump administration has proposed defunding it or eliminating 80 to 90 percent of its workforce, similar to what it has done to the US Agency for International Development. This will cripple the agency’s ability to improve the health care system, which is in dire need of improvement. Advertisement I am a physician and health services researcher, and AHRQ has been the major funder of my research for the past 25 years. As a hospitalist — a general internist who cares for acutely ill medical patients in the hospital — my concern is the quality of health care for patients regardless of the disease they have. Indeed, most of my patients have multiple chronic diseases, and often new conditions as well. Unlike the various institutes of the National Institutes of Health, which concern themselves with one disease at a time, AHRQ focuses on patients as a whole and acknowledges that many patients have more than one condition. Over the years, AHRQ has funded my research in a number of areas, such as how to make sure patients take their medications safely and correctly when they leave the hospital, how to improve electronic medical records so they make care better and not worse, how to improve handoffs in the hospital (such as when a medical resident goes home for the night), and how to reduce diagnostic errors and delays in the hospital. Most of my colleagues depend on AHRQ funding as well. Over the past decade, AHRQ has funded some of the most significant health services research conducted in the United States, from how to prevent hospital-acquired infections to how best to treat opioid use disorders in rural populations , how to improve communication among health care workers , how to improve patients’ health literacy , and how to speed time to admission from the emergency department . It is estimated that implementing just one AHRQ-funded study on reducing hospital-acquired conditions prevented an estimated 20,500 deaths and saved $7.7 billion in health care costs from 2014 to 2017. Advertisement So if the administration’s stated goal is to “Make America Healthy Again,” why cut the only federal agency whose sole mission it is to improve the quality and safety of health care delivery? AHRQ has in fact been a target of Republican administrations for years, and the reasons have varied over time . This time, it could be part of broader anti-DEI efforts (since some health services research focuses on disparities in care by race, ethnicity, and gender). Or it could be part of a general attack on federally funded medical and scientific research. Most likely, it is the false belief that studies of what works in health care will lead to rationing and government overreach. It is true that some AHRQ-funded research concerns itself with identifying care that is ineffective or inferior to other alternatives. As for rationing, well, insurance companies ration health care all the time by not covering certain medications and procedures or by denying care. Wouldn’t it be better if decisions about what care is worth receiving were based on the best evidence of what works and who benefits? Regardless of political affiliation, we can agree that patient safety and effective health care should be protected — not politicized. The Trump administration may cynically assume that no one will miss AHRQ if it’s gone. After all, most people have never heard of it. And its half a billion dollar budget is small potatoes compared with $50 billion for NIH. But you will indeed miss it if the quality and safety of health care delivery deteriorates because of a lack of knowledge of how to improve them. Congress must step in and safeguard AHRQ’s funding, and citizens should speak out, urging their representatives to support this vital resource. Given the current state of health care in this country, AHRQ’s budget should be increased, not eliminated. By protecting AHRQ, Americans can choose a health care system driven by evidence, guided by safety, and committed to the best outcomes for all. Advertisement

New ‘Game Changer’ Health Care Bill Would Make Health Sharing Payments Tax Deductible The practice allows members to pool their money and pay for each other’s health care costs, similar to traditional insurance plans. United States Capitol building in Washington, D.C. (photo: Vlad / Shutterstock) Madalaine Elhabbal/CNA Nation March 24, 2025 Three U.S. representatives have introduced a bill that supports American taxpayers who choose to participate in health sharing, a care option favored by Christians and pro-lifers for its religious freedom protections. If passed, the Health Care Sharing Ministry Tax Parity Act would designate health sharing payments as tax deductable, alleviating costs for families who opt for health sharing over traditional health coverage, many of whom do so for religious reasons. The act was introduced by U.S. Reps. Mike Kelly, R-Pennsylvania; Greg Murphy, R-North Carolina; and Chris Smith, R-New Jersey. “Unfairly, Americans have been historically penalized by the tax code when they chose to use faith-based health care sharing ministries to meet their health care needs. The Health Care Sharing Ministry Tax Parity Act will remedy this problem, ensuring Americans are no longer disadvantaged by the tax code for their religious beliefs,” Smith said in a press release on March 14 . Health sharing became a popular alternative to mainstream insurance coverage over a decade ago with the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, which included a mandate from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services requiring insurance plans to fund contraception, sterilizations, and early abortion pills. The practice allows members to pool their money and pay for each other’s health care costs, similar to traditional insurance plans. Legal disputes over religious freedom violations that precipitated from the Affordable Care Act continue today, with the Supreme Court set to hear a case in June regarding a part of the law governing preventative care. “Americans should have choices when it comes to their health care. For many families, traditional insurance is a great option. For some, however, particularly people of faith, alternative options such as health care sharing ministries more closely align with their values,” Kelly said in the release. “This legislation preserves that choice for families by allowing them to deduct payments made as part of their ministry membership in their taxes by classifying regular ministry expenses as medical care expenses,” he added. “It’s time we focus on initiatives that reintroduce freedom and dignity back to our health care system.” Solidarity HealthShare collaborated with the three congressmen on the legislation. Founded in 2012 in wake of the Affordable Care Act, Solidarity HealthShare facilitates health sharing among individuals and families across the country who are looking to opt out of traditional insurance for a more faith-centered option. “Solidarity is grateful for the leadership and support of Congressman Mike Kelly and his team, who have consistently taken the lead in working for tax parity for health care sharing ministry members,” Solidarity HealthShare President Chris Faddis and CEO Brad Hahn told CNA in a statement. “His introduction of the Health Care Sharing Ministry Tax Parity Act has the potential to be a game changer for families who have chosen to escape the troubled landscape of traditional health insurance but have been unable to benefit from tax deductions available to other Americans,” the executives added. “This bill is the culmination of an industry-wide effort to provide tax relief to members of health care sharing ministries,” they said, adding: “We are also thankful for the support of the Alliance of Health Care Sharing and other health care sharing ministry partners for advancing this effort.” Keywords: catholic healthcare Toggle Comments Show Comments

With a commitment to excellence, HCT is transforming health care training through advanced technology, immersive learning experiences and strategic international partnerships. The HCT, the Philippines’ largest health care skills training center, is at the forefront of transforming health care education through advanced technology, strategic global partnerships and a steadfast commitment to bridging the gap between academia and industry. Upholding the highest worldwide training standards, HCT has been leading health care education advances since its founding in 2007. By incorporating best practices from international health care organizations, HCT has produced generations of Filipino medical professionals who are equipped to handle the challenges of a constantly evolving field. “The world knows Filipino nurses to be the best. What you don’t often see or hear is that the first six months of employment are the worst, as stated by many medical doctors,” said HCT president Armand del Rosario. In order to keep its training programs in line with international standards, HCT works closely with leaders and organizations in the health care industry worldwide. To keep up with new developments and industry best practices, especially when it comes to incorporating technology into instruction, the institute attends international conferences. “We’ve witnessed how the Western world has incorporated virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) into health care education,” Del Rosario said. “Now, we’re making sure Filipino nurses gain access to the same innovations.” A testament to this commitment is HCT’s recent three-year partnership with UbiSim, the world’s leading virtual reality simulation platform for nurses. Exclusively run on Meta Quest VR headsets, UbiSim provides immersive, hands-on training that enhances clinical judgment, decision-making and confidence among students. While the UbiSim partnership marks a major milestone for HCT, the institute is also exploring future collaborations to expand its impact beyond the Philippines. According to Del Rosario, “We have pending partnerships in Europe, Canada and the US. At this time, we are concentrating on optimizing the potential of virtual reality training, but we are also considering how we can apply our knowledge to other healthcare domains and regions in the future.” Through consistent innovation, bolstering international collaborations and ensuring that training aligns with real-world needs, HCT is reinventing the future of health care education. The institute’s innovative work is shaping the next generation of medical professionals and enhancing the Philippines’ standing as a world leader in health care education.

Title: How to make health care affordable for more Rhode Islanders ? Look for the union label . 
Date: 20250324T103000Z
URL: https://www.yahoo.com/news/health-care-affordable-more-rhode-093032334.html

Article Content:
Dozens of Lifespan employees gather for the announcement of the health system's name change to Brown university Health during a press conference in the lobby of Hasbro Children’s Hospital on June 20, 2024. Rhode Island has nearly 15,000 unionized health care workers. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current) The Rhode Island health care system faces a number of significant threats to its viability. In Washington, D.C., Congressional Republicans are proposing significant cuts to Medicaid spending , while locally, for-profit hospital owners are filing for bankruptcy protection and state leaders grapple with the fallou t. As labor leaders, we share the concerns of many Rhode Islanders about the condition of our health care system. In our small state of just over 1 million people, over 50% of us are insured through either Medicare or Medicaid . In our hospitals, over 70% of patients are covered by public health care plans. That leaves only 25% of hospital patients covered by commercial insurance, well below our neighboring states of Massachusetts (30%) and Connecticut (29%). What most Rhode Islanders might not know: The next largest group of insured Rhode Islanders get their health care from a union-negotiated health insurance plan, whether they are a union member or not. Even though there are about 9,000 unionized state employees, approximately 33,000 people are insured through union plans. It’s not only because of the dependents we cover, but also because our plan also covers non-union workers like managers and supervisors, as well as their families. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement In the Ocean State, there are close to 15,000 unionized health care workers; so, not only are our members consumers of health care services, but we are also providers of health care. We have a vested interest in making sure our health care system is as strong as possible. That is why we believe all Rhode Islanders who are concerned about the state of our health care system should encourage more workers to join labor unions where they work. To us, increased unionization is a key component to a strategy ensuring every Rhode Islander has access to affordable health care services while simultaneously addressing a health care funding crisis that seems to get more precarious by the day. As a recent poll commissioned by the Rhode Island AFL-CIO found, there is strong public support for unions in the Ocean State, with more than eight in 10 Rhode Islanders agreeing that unions “are necessary to protect the working person.” There are just over 500,000 Rhode Island based non-farm jobs in the state according to the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training . About 80,000 of these jobs are protected by collective bargaining agreements. We know from sources like the U.S. Department of Treasury that not only do unions raise the wages of their members by 10 to 15%compared to similar non-union jobs, but that all workers in markets with a heavy union presence see economic improvements. On top of that, 96% of union members have employer- provided health insurance compared to just 69% of non-union workers. We have a vested interest in making sure our health care system is as strong as possible. That is why we believe all Rhode Islanders who are concerned about the state of our health care system should encourage more workers to join labor unions where they work. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Now imagine there were 10,000 more union members in Rhode Island by the end of 2025. If the average wage paid to a Rhode Island worker averages $65,000 per year , and these workers, through collective bargaining, could increase their wages by 10%, that would mean the individual worker would see a salary increase of $6,500. In a state with just over 1 million people, that means an additional $65 million in economic activity, leading to increased tax revenues from income and sales taxes. It would also mean these 10,000 workers, and their dependents, would be much more likely to have commercial health insurance. This could equate to as many as 25,000 fewer people on Medicare, meaning our hospitals would receive adequate payments for the services they provide, instead of relying on low reimbursement rates from public health insurance plans. Please don’t misunderstand our point of view. As trade unionists, we believe that in a perfect world, there would be some form of national health care system where every American’s health care would be provided for without concern for the cost to the patient and their family. But we don’t live in a perfect world, and Rhode Island is confronting a crisis today. According to Rhode Island General Laws § 28-7-2 , “…it is declared to be the public policy of the state to encourage the practice and procedure of collective bargaining.” This section of law refers not only to the public sector workers, but to those in the private sector as well. It is why the AFL-CIO refers to Rhode Island as a “labor state” and why, we think, we can use the power of organized labor to help address Rhode Island’s health care crisis. That is why we are calling on the collective leadership of the state — elected officials, business, community, and other civic leaders — to join with us during the next few months as the General Assembly debates next year’s state budget and encourage as many Rhode Islanders as possible to join with their coworkers and negotiate for better wages and benefits. The entire state of Rhode Island would be better off if more of our proudly working-class state were part of organized labor. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE About Our Ads

Idaho Governor Signs Bill to Protect Religious, Conscience Rights of Doctors and Nurses Religious-freedom protections are bolstered. Idaho Capitol (photo: Shutterstock) Tyler Arnold/CNA Nation March 21, 2025 Idaho Gov. Brad Little this week signed legislation that bolsters religious-freedom protections for doctors, nurses and other medical professionals when they object to performing certain procedures or providing certain services. The new law , signed on Wednesday, amends the Medical Ethics Defense Act to clearly establish that Idaho recognizes “that the right of conscience is a fundamental and inalienable right” whether one’s conscience “is informed by religious, moral, or ethical beliefs or principles.” Under the law, no health care professional, health care institution, or health care payer can be forced to participate in or pay for any medical procedure, treatment, or service to which he or she objects as a matter of conscience. The law also prevents employers from retaliating or punishing an employee based on his or her conscience objections to any medical service. It states that a person should communicate his or her conscience objection to the employer as soon as reasonably possible to ensure necessary staffing adjustments can take place. Under the law, a health care provider cannot be held criminally or civilly liable for refusing to provide a medical service because of the institution’s conscience objection. Some objections from Catholic institutions or health care professionals could include procedures and services related to abortion, contraception, and transgender drugs and surgeries. Greg Chafuen, who serves as legal counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom, said in a statement that “patients are best served by health care professionals who are free to act consistent with their oath to ‘do no harm.’” “Unfortunately, doctors and nurses have been targeted for caring for their patients by refraining from harmful and dangerous procedures,” he said. “What may be worse, countless young professionals are kept out of the health care field because of fear that they will be forced to violate their conscience.” Chaufen added that the Idaho law “ensures that health care professionals are not forced to participate in procedures that violate their ethical, moral, or religious beliefs.” Idaho’s law also establishes stronger free speech protections by prohibiting departments and regulatory boards from punishing health care providers for engaging in speech, expression, or association that is protected under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution from government interference. The law also creates a framework for health care institutions and health care professionals to file lawsuits to remedy any violations of the new regulations.

[Photo/Xinhua] Hainan province, one of China's most popular tourist destinations, recently launched a three-year action plan to boost its healthcare sector, with the unveiling of various supportive measures, such as transforming existing buildings into healthcare facilities and reducing land leasing costs for businesses. According to the plan, some existing buildings could be redeveloped, allowing for the transformation of facilities including vacant commercial spaces, factories, school buildings, offices and training facilities into those for healthcare services. Hotels and resorts could launch such services if their operational conditions meet regulatory standards. Enterprises are also being encouraged to redevelop residential properties into such service facilities after necessary checks. Gao Min, president of the Hainan Health and Wellness Tourism Association, highlighted the potential of the plan. "The transformation of existing properties into healthcare service facilities can boost the development progress of the province's healthcare sector," Gao said. "With the measures transforming more existing facilities into healthcare facilities, Hainan will be better able to meet the ever-upgrading demands from tourists." The plan also advocates for the development of rural collective construction land. Sun Xiangtao, executive director of the Hainan Rural Holiday Tourism Association, said: "Over the past few years, rural tourism in Hainan has seen significant improvements in terms of infrastructure and services, along with a refreshed ecological environment, making Hainan an ideal choice for travelers looking for healthcare services. "The plan will also boost village homestays and lift the occupancy rate of rural tourism accommodation, contributing to the development of Hainan's rural healthcare tourism." The island province aims to build a niche market by launching healthcare projects that leverage its natural conditions, and medical and cultural resources. Hainan has the charm to attract investment and major enterprises to this end, experts said. "Flexible land supply, along with policies promoting the transformation of existing properties, have lowered the barriers for entry, making it particularly attractive among small and medium-sized enterprises as well as newcomers," Gao said.

Audio By Carbonatix The Ghana Chamber of Private Medical Groups (Chamber of Health) has expressed its readiness to work with the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) to improve private healthcare delivery and strengthen Ghana’s health insurance system. The Chamber, led by its president, Dr Andre Kwasi Kumah, On Thursday paid a courtesy call on NHIA Chief Executive Officer, Mr Victor Asare Bampoe at the head office of the Authority in Accra. The meeting introduced the newly formed Chamber and provided an opportunity to discuss concerns affecting private healthcare providers. It also explored ways for the private sector to work more effectively with the NHIA. Dr Kumah explained that the organisation was created to unite private healthcare service providers and give them a stronger voice in engaging policymakers. “When we assumed office two years ago, we realised the private health sector was fragmented, making it difficult to engage effectively with policymakers,” he said. “At our AGM, we decided to bring all players in the private health sector together under one umbrella to strengthen our discussions with stakeholders.” He welcomed the NHIA’s recent policy measures, including the uncapping of the National Health Insurance Levy (NHIL) and ongoing tariff reviews, expressing hope that these would lead to timely and adequate reimbursements for healthcare providers. Private sector concerns The delegation raised several issues affecting private healthcare providers, including tariff reviews, payment delays, and the role of private facilities in national health initiatives. Mr Charles Fordjour, a representative of the Healthcare Federation of Ghana and a member of the delegation said private health facilities play an important role in the country’s healthcare system. He noted that in many sub-Saharan African countries, private providers deliver over 60% of health services. “We need to change the perception that healthcare solutions should only centre on the public sector,” he said. “Private hospitals, pharmacies, and diagnostic centres are a major part of the system, and policies must reflect that reality.” Dr Mrs Rebecca Acquaah-Arhin, another member of the delegation, called for fair tariff structures under the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), arguing that private hospitals provide crucial services under the scheme and should be adequately supported. “If NHIS is covering patients in private hospitals, then the tariffs must reflect the actual cost of service delivery,” she said. “We are not just running businesses; we are contributing to national healthcare.” NHIA’s response NHIA Deputy CEO (Operations), Dr Senanu Kwesi Djokoto, acknowledged the role of private health facilities in expanding access to healthcare. While private providers operate as businesses, he noted that they also serve public health needs and should be included in national healthcare planning. “For us to achieve universal health coverage, government and the private sector must work together,” he said. “We recognise the role of private facilities, and ongoing discussions will help address challenges such as the fair distribution of health services and human resource allocation.” Dr Bampoe welcomed the Chamber’s initiative and assured the delegation that the NHIA was open to engaging private healthcare providers. He said the Authority was working to improve efficiency, transparency, and service delivery, particularly through technology-driven solutions. “A major challenge for us is addressing illegal co-payments, which erode public confidence in the NHIS,” he explained. “We recognise that this issue is tied to tariff levels and payment timelines, and we are working on solutions to address it.” Mr Bampoe outlined the NHIA’s priorities, including improving claims processing, tackling illegal co-payments, and advancing the government’s plans for free primary healthcare and the Mahama Cares initiative, which deals with non-communicable diseases. “We are working to ensure that NHIS payments are prompt and that tariffs are realistic,” he said. “But beyond that, we must strengthen controls to eliminate illegal charges and build a system where basic healthcare is accessible to all,” he added. The meeting ended with both parties agreeing to continue discussions to strengthen Ghana’s healthcare system.

Money Report In partnership with news ‘Everyone' over 18 should make this 1 estate planning move, attorney says—you can do it for free By Judy Lagrou, CNBC • Published March 21, 2025 • Updated on March 21, 2025 at 9:13 am BOOKMARKER Goodboy Picture Company | E+ | Getty Images Estate planning isn't just for the rich or the elderly . Anyone can die or become incapacitated — and without the right legal documents in place, your family and loved ones may be left struggling to make important decisions and paying thousands of dollars in legal fees. There's one simple estate planning move anyone can make to help your family avoid costly and time-consuming court battles, says Zach Wiegand, an attorney at Gold Leaf Estate Planning in Burnsville, Minnesota. "Everyone over the age of 18 should have a health-care directive," Weigand says. Watch NBC 4 free wherever you are WATCH HERE Simply put, a health-care directive — otherwise known as an advance directive — is an umbrella term for legal documents in which you name a specific person to make decisions about your health care if an injury or illness renders you unable to do so. Without these documents, the state decides who will make medical decisions on your behalf, which may not be the person you want. "If something happens to you, your parents can't just step in; they need legal authority," says Eido Walny, attorney and founder of Walny Legal Group in Milwaukee. That's why a health-care directive is so important, he says. This is also critical to have if you're engaged, in a same-sex partnership or wish to appoint a close friend to make health-care decisions on your behalf. Without a health-care directive, your loved ones may have to petition the court for guardianship, which might require them to "pay thousands of dollars for an attorney to go to court," Weigand says. The process could go on until you either recover or pass away. "That can be a huge burden on a family," Weigand says. How to complete a health-care directive for free A health-care directive consists of a living will and a health-care power of attorney. Although the exact definition of each varies by state, a living will generally explains your health-care wishes, particularly concerning end-of-life care. A health-care power of attorney names an individual to make health-care decisions on your behalf, whether or not your condition is terminal. Good news: You don't have to spend hundreds of dollars to put these documents in place. The National Alliance for Care at Home and AARP both offer free health-care directive forms for every state that you and your loved ones can complete and print out in minutes. Once completed, most states require your health-care directive to be either notarized or signed in front of witnesses. No matter your state's specific rules, the National Institute on Aging recommends that you provide copies of your health-care directive to your chosen health-care proxy , family members and doctor. Most hospitals also provide free health-care directives upon request, says Weigand. They'll place a copy in your medical records to make sure it is honored in an emergency. If you would rather have someone else handle this planning for you, Walny recommends scheduling a consultation with a local estate planning attorney to understand all of your options. "Many estate planning attorneys are happy to sit down with you [to discuss your health-care directive] and not charge you for it," Walny says. "Having that conversation can be very, very helpful, and if you don't like the fee, you can walk away." An attorney can also help you complete a durable power of attorney, which allows a loved one to pay your bills and manage your finances should you become incapacitated. "If you're in a coma in the hospital, and someone needs to access your bank account to pay your cell phone bill or pay your rent, having a power of attorney document in place is really important," Weigand says.

By Allison Perry March 21, 2025 LEXINGTON, Ky. (March 21, 2025) – After extensive efforts to negotiate a new agreement, UK HealthCare announced that its contract with insurance company Cigna Healthcare will end on May 1, 2025. This change means that, as of that date, UK HealthCare facilities and providers will no longer be part of Cigna’s medical insurance network. Despite numerous proposals over the past several months to establish a fair and sustainable fee schedule, UK HealthCare and Cigna have been unable to reach mutually agreeable terms. As a result, and following Cigna's expressed desire to conclude negotiations, UK HealthCare will no longer be an in-network provider for Cigna members after April 30. About 4,500 patients at UK HealthCare are anticipated to be impacted by the change. UK HealthCare remains committed to ensuring these patients receive uninterrupted, high-quality care during this transition. Cigna patients will continue to have in-network access to UK HealthCare services through April 30. Affected patients are encouraged to contact Cigna for guidance on care options and to stay informed about how this change may impact their health care services. UK HealthCare is also seeking further information from Cigna to assist patients requiring continuity of care for ongoing treatment after the contract ends. After April 30, access to UK HealthCare’s emergency departments will still be available to patients for covered emergency services, regardless of network status. Learn more about what emergency services are covered under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. For additional information, patients can visit UK HealthCare’s FAQ page or contact Cigna by calling the number on the back of their insurance card. A list of insurance providers accepted at UK HealthCare is available here . In the 2023-24 fiscal year, UK HealthCare hospitals managed more than 45,000 patient discharges, more than 38,000 surgeries, over 123,000 emergency department visits and more than 1.4 million hospital-based outpatient clinic visits. UK HealthCare is the hospitals and clinics of the University of Kentucky. But it is so much more. It is more than 10,000 dedicated health care professionals committed to providing advanced subspecialty care for the most critically injured and ill patients from the Commonwealth and beyond. It also is the home of the state’s only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, a Level IV Neonatal Intensive Care Unit that cares for the tiniest and sickest newborns and the region’s only Level 1 trauma center. As an academic research institution, we are continuously pursuing the next generation of cures, treatments, protocols and policies. Our discoveries have the potential to change what’s medically possible within our lifetimes. Our educators and thought leaders are transforming the health care landscape as our six health professions colleges teach the next generation of doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other health care professionals, spreading the highest standards of care. UK HealthCare is the power of advanced medicine committed to creating a healthier Kentucky, now and for generations to come.

The Nigerian Government has been advised to integrate Artificial Intelligence-driven telemedicine healthcare in the nation’s hospitals. Prof. Chuks Ekwueme, the Chairman of Uniccon, gave this advice on Thursday while addressing reporters in Abuja, adding that such move would transform Nigeria’s healthcare landscape. He said a country of over 200 million citizens should work towards making the healthcare system easily accessible and affordable. According to him, Nigeria should aim at expanding access to quality healthcare in rural communities. Ekwueme said healthcare should be convenient, not complicated, adding that AI-driven telemedicine healthcare would ensure access to quality medical advice in minutes to anyone, regardless of location or financial status. Ekwueme said such AI system would offer users/patients a robust healthcare application, that would ease or bridge the gap in accessing healthcare service in Africa, especially when individuals understand how hectic the process could be, due to fewer nor underfunded medical facilities. He said this initiative would provide instant virtual consultations, smart symptom analysis, and accessible healthcare services across the country. “It will also reduce cost, gap in manpower supply, increase efficiency, increase reach and reduce stress on government facilities,” he said “It will be a very good initiative for Government owned hospitals to collaborate with telemedicine providers, by integrating that into it’s hospital management system. “With a doctor-to-patient ratio far below WHO recommendations…AI system will help to analyse symptoms and recommend next steps, significantly reducing consultation times and improving diagnosis accuracy. “Given the shortfall in healthcare workers, health centers and funding, Telemedicine remains the easiest, fastest and affordable means of offering a certain category of health services to the rural areas. He said that the telemedicine does not supplant physical consultation or examination, especially in the cases of emergency.

Bihar Exit Polls 2025: BJP's Maithili Thakur to lose Alinagar seat? Here's what pollsters said The Growing Challenge of Medical Inflation The relentless rise of medical inflation remains one of the most pressing issues in India’s healthcare landscape in 2025. According to several leading surveys, India’s medical inflation is expected to rise, with costs increasing by 13.2%—a scary 0.9% higher than the Asia-Pacific average of 12.3%. This trend is driven by several factors, including healthcare technology advancements, skyrocketing demand for sophisticated treatments, and historically high labor costs. The impact of this is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it is straining household budgets; on the other, it is underscoring the importance of health insurance . Think about it, organ transplant surgeries can cost upwards of 20 lakhs, making it nearly impossible for a large section of the population to afford without insurance. At the same time, India’s large population and growing middle class create a strong demand for better healthcare services that drives supply constraints, and in turn, higher costs. This is further compounded by the limited talent pool of healthcare professionals, which limits the availability of affordable care. Another key driver of medical inflation is the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on healthcare spending associated with emergency healthcare supplies and services. For all the physical and financial ruin the pandemic left in its wake, it did reveal the vulnerability of the Indian healthcare system and brought to light the need for robust financial protection mechanisms like health insurance. Why Health Insurance is More Important than Ever As the healthcare sector continues to evolve, managing these costs requires strategic planning, including opting for comprehensive health insurance policies that cover a wide range of medical expenses. Unfortunately, the rising medical costs have a direct influence on health insurance premiums as insurers face higher claims due to increased treatment costs. With rising medical costs, health insurance premiums are also increasing. In 2025, premiums are expected to rise by 10% to 15% due to higher treatment costs, increased claims, and regulatory changes. This trend makes health insurance not just a precaution but a critical financial tool. Take Ramesh’s story, for example. Last year, Ramesh, a 42-year-old schoolteacher, suffered a heart attack. The hospital bill came to ₹8 lakhs—an amount that could have wiped out his family’s savings. Fortunately, Ramesh had a health insurance policy that covered most of the expenses. "Without the insurance, I don’t know how we would have managed," he said. "It allowed us to focus on my recovery rather than stressing about the money." This is but one of the many stories that perfectly illustrates how critical health insurance can be. Health insurance isn’t just about financial relief during a medical emergency. Comprehensive policies often cover preventive care like annual health check-ups and screenings, enabling early diagnosis and treatment. Catching health issues early reduces the risk of severe complications and helps manage chronic conditions more effectively. Government Initiatives and the Path Ahead According to the Impact and Policy Research Institute (IMPRI), despite a 10% increase in the health sector budget for 2025-26, India's healthcare spending remains low compared to other major economies, at 3.28% of GDP. This low spending is a concern, given the vast and diverse healthcare needs of the population. To address this issue, the government has increased allocations to health initiatives like Ayushman Bharat and medical infrastructure development. The latter includes efforts to enhance public healthcare infrastructure and reshore medical supplies manufacturing to mitigate the effects of medical inflation. The former, Ayushman Bharat, is one of the largest health insurance schemes worldwide. It aims to provide financial protection to over 100 million poor and vulnerable families with a scheme that offers a cover of up to Rs. 5 lakhs per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization. By expanding health insurance coverage under such schemes, the government aims to reduce out-of-pocket expenses for healthcare, which currently accounts for a significant portion of household spending. According to PRS Legislative Research, the Indian government’s health expenditure and initiatives in the 2025-26 budget are set to ensure equitable access to healthcare across the nation’s population. Despite these efforts, challenges persist. The financial strain of healthcare costs is evident in the fact that 62% of hospital costs in India are paid out of pocket, with 23% funded through borrowings. This financial burden often leads to catastrophic health expenditure, pushing families into poverty. With health insurance, this risk can be mitigated and families can rest easy knowing that their medical emergencies won’t lead them to financial crises. As medical inflation continues to rise, individuals must consider health insurance not just as a precautionary measure but as a necessary investment in their health and financial security. By understanding the causes of medical inflation and the benefits of health insurance, individuals can better navigate the challenges of the healthcare system. The government's initiatives to enhance healthcare infrastructure and expand insurance coverage are crucial steps toward ensuring that more citizens have access to affordable healthcare. However, individual responsibility in securing health insurance remains vital to managing the financial risks associated with rising healthcare costs. As India moves forward, it is essential to address the systemic challenges that contribute to medical inflation. This includes investing in healthcare infrastructure, promoting domestic manufacturing of medical supplies, and ensuring that health insurance policies are comprehensive and accessible to all segments of society. By combining these efforts with individual actions to secure health insurance, India can better mitigate the impacts of rising medical costs and ensure a healthier, more financially secure future for its citizens.

Title: Lawmakers vote in favor of bill addressing sexual misconduct in health care , following Tribune report

Article Content:
A sweeping bill that would expand reporting requirements related to sexual misconduct allegations against health care workers and impose fines for failure to report serious incidents gained initial approval from a House committee Wednesday. The bill follows a Tribune investigation last year that exposed how Illinois health care systems failed to protect patients from sexual abuse and how state government failed to hold them accountable. State Rep. Kelly Cassidy, D-Chicago, the bill’s sponsor, said during the hearing that the legislation will close a “critical gap” in communication and could “prevent dangerous behaviors from being hidden or left unaddressed within health care settings.” She referenced the Tribune investigation while presenting the initial version of the bill Wednesday. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Tribune series identified multiple well-known Illinois health systems that had fielded allegations of sexual abuse but allowed those physicians, nurses and other workers to continue caring for patients. The reporting also exposed gaps in state oversight of the health care industry that left patients vulnerable to harm. One story in the series revealed how Endeavor Health allowed obstetrician and gynecologist Fabio Ortega to continue seeing patients despite complaints about his conduct and after learning that he was under police investigation. Ortega later pleaded guilty to felony criminal sexual abuse of two patients. The doctor was accused of abuse by dozens of former patients, and Endeavor Health has settled more than 75 lawsuits related to those allegations. In November the health system disclosed it was spending $453 million on “costs, expenses and settlement of claims” related to a doctor it did not name accused of sexually abusing patients. Cassidy noted that while the legislature passed a bill last year that addressed one issue — a law that expanded which health care facilities must report patient abuse allegations to the Illinois Department of Public Health — “the problem goes well beyond that.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The new bill would require that health professionals who witness or hear about sexual misconduct by health care workers to report it to the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, which oversees health care workers’ licenses, within 24 hours. Health institutions would also be required to report allegations of misconduct to IDFPR within 24 hours of initiating an investigation into alleged misconduct, or when a worker is terminated or resigns following an allegation of misconduct. It would impose fines of $25,000 to $75,000 for failure to report and then place that money into a sexual assault survivors fund. The bill also expands reporting requirements for law enforcement, instructing law enforcement agencies to notify IDFPR within 30 days of opening an investigation into a licensed health care worker, arresting a health care worker or filing felony or serious misdemeanor charges against the person. In December, the Tribune revealed that despite a law mandating prompt action when licensed health care workers are charged with certain criminal offenses, it often took the state weeks or months to require that the health professional only provide care under the supervision of a medical chaperone or for the state to take other action. The bill is joint effort by IDFPR, IDPH and Gov. JB Pritzker’s office, along with Cassidy, she said. The Illinois Health and Hospital Association is currently in opposition to the bill, but the association’s senior vice president of government relations, David Gross, told committee members the group is working with the representative in coming to an agreement. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “What is not fleshed out yet is the role and responsibilities of the state and its agencies in ensuring prompt resolution to what could essentially be thousands of unfounded reports,” Gross said. State Rep. William Hauter, a Republican from Morton, said he was in support of the effort but raised concerns about the bill. Hauter, who is an emergency medicine doctor and anesthesiologist, said health care workers often deal with patients with altered mental states. “Our licenses, that’s a thing that we worked our whole life for, and to have that stain on there, even if it’s going to be investigated and removed, in some way I feel like it’s really putting a lot of health professionals at risk,” Hauter said. Cassidy responded that she understands the concerns of health care providers, but also wants to ensure that the facilities and health systems are addressing and not hiding these issues. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “I want to make sure that we strike a better balance than we currently have,” she said. The Health Care Licenses Committee voted 9-5 Wednesday in favor of the initial bill, but Cassidy said she planned to bring the matter back to the committee with an amendment before the bill moves to the House floor. Tamara Holder, an attorney who represented many of the women who filed lawsuits against Ortega and Endeavor, said the bill would force more communication when it comes to allegations of sexual abuse against health care workers. “Regardless of what the recipient thinks or feels about the information, it creates a legal duty to do something, which is to report it,” Holder said. _____ About Our Ads

By Rachel Rabkin Peachman , Forbes Staff. Rachel Rabkin Peachman is a Forbes senior editor. Follow Author Mar 19, 2025, 04:04pm EDT Updated Mar 20, 2025, 01:20pm EDT Share Save The Top 100 F or the past 10 years, Forbes has ranked America’s Best Employers—tracking companies and organizations as they’ve navigated an era of lightning-speed technological innovation, economic and geopolitical instability, a global pandemic that prompted drastic changes in how and where we do business, and cultural and generational shifts that have amalgamated the composition of the country’s adult workforce . Throughout all the changes, however, research over the past decade has shown that employees have remained relatively steadfast when asked what they care about most in an employer : compensation , employee development and advancement opportunities, meaningful work, supportive colleagues, and workplace well-being and flexibility. Most recently, a global survey of business leaders conducted in 2024 by AESC —a membership association for the industry of executive search and leadership consulting—found that the top factors that attract and retain leaders in the United States workforce are, once again, compensation packages and work-life balance. Finding Work, Life Balance getty images To assess which employers met or exceeded workers’ expectations this year, Forbes partnered with market research firm Statista to produce our 10th anniversary editions of America’s Best Midsize Employers and America’s Best Large Employers. The annual rankings were based primarily on survey responses from more than 217,000 employees working at companies within the U.S. that employ more than 1,000 people. The organizations were stratified so that companies with 1,000 to 5,000 employees were deemed midsize, while companies with more than 5,000 employees were considered large employers. Survey respondents (who remained anonymous so they could answer freely) were asked if they would recommend their employer to others and to rate it based on a range of criteria, including salary, work environment, training programs and opportunities to advance. Participants were also asked if they would recommend their previous employers (within the past two years) and the employers they knew through their industry experience or through friends or family who worked there. The responses were tallied and analyzed along with additional survey data from the last three years, which allowed for a robust assessment of organizations that consistently ranked well versus those that may have had just one good year. The more recent data and the evaluations from current employees were weighted more heavily than others. Ultimately, each employer was given a score, and the 1,199 organizations with the highest scores landed on one of our two final lists—498 on America’s Best Midsize Employers 2025 and 701 on America’s Best Large Employers 2025 . For the Top 100 employers on Forbes’ list of America’s Best Large Employers 2025, see below. As with all Forbes lists, companies pay no fee to participate or be selected.

High-level panel for non-financial sector reforms to start work soon: Finance Secretary In her Budget speech last month, the Finance Minister had announced creation of a high-level panel to review all non-financial sector regulations, certifications, licences, and permissions By PTI Updated - March 29, 2025 at 08:26 PM. | New Delhi × Share WhatsApp X Facebook LinkedIn Messenger Reddit Mail https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/high-level-panel-for-regulatory-reforms-in-non-financial-sector-to-begin-work-soon-finance-secretary/article69389523.ece Copy File picture: Ajay Seth, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs | Photo Credit: ANI Finance Secretary and Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth on Saturday said a high-level committee for regulatory reforms in the non-financial sector would begin work soon to foster ease of doing business as announced in the Budget 2025-26. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her Budget speech last month, had announced creation of a high-level committee for regulatory reforms for a review of all non-financial sector regulations, certifications, licences, and permissions. "The committee will be expected to make recommendations within a year. The objective is to strengthen trust-based economic governance and take transformational measures to enhance 'ease of doing business', especially in matters of inspections and compliances. States will be encouraged to join in this endeavour," she had said. Observing that a number of structural reforms have been announced in the last 10 years, Seth said, at the same time keeping those reforms in tandem with technological advancement, removing legislative provisions which have outlived their utility, and maintaining their relevance in the 21st century and the next 23 years requirement have to be looked at. There is a need to move towards light touch regulatory reforms, which are people-friendly, which are modern and flexible, he said at SKOCH Summit here. "So this initiative of a high-level committee on regulatory reforms in the non-financial sector work should be starting soon," he said. To promote competitive cooperative federalism among states and also to assess which state is more investor friendly, Seth said, an Investment Friendliness Index of States will be launched. This will generate healthy competition among states and promote business friendly reforms to attract investment, he said. "Our journey towards Viksit Bharat is possible only when everybody comes together, all people, all regions (and) all states," he added. Speaking about financial sector reforms to be undertaken by the Financial Stability and Development Council, Seth said, the objective is to support development, and at the same time allow for more efficient use of capital. Under the Financial Stability and Development Council, a mechanism will be set up to evaluate the impact of the current financial regulations and subsidiary instructions, and it will also formulate a framework to enhance their responsiveness and development of the financial sector, Sitharaman had said in Budget 2025-26. The Financial Stability and Development Council is headed by the Finance Minister and all financial sector regulators, including the RBI, SEBI, IRDAI and PFRDA, are its members.

Click here to return to FAST Tap here to return to FAST FAST JAKARTA :The role of the Indonesia's central bank must be strengthened to help support the government's economic growth target of 8 per cent by 2029, a lawmaker heading a parliamentary committee overseeing the financial sector said on Friday. Mukhamad Misbakhun said the commission has been preparing measures on how parliament could help the government to achieve its 8 per cent target from the current 5 per cent, including strengthening the roles of the finance ministry as well as Bank Indonesia. "If our economic growth is driven by two engines of fiscal and monetary policy, this will be a strong national combination going forward," he said at a capital markets forum in Jakarta. Misbakhun did not elaborate on how the central bank's role could be enhanced and no decision has been taken to date. He said discussions were still ongoing and said he had met BI officials the previous night.

Loading "We want that even though BI is an independent institution, but it's independent in the process, but not independent in our purpose of statehood," the lawmaker added. Indonesia's economic growth has hovered at around 5 per cent in the past few years. Parliament is discussing a revision of the 2023 Development and Strengthening of the Financial Sector Law, after the Constitutional Court ordered lawmakers earlier this year to review it on matters related to the independence of the state deposit insurer agency. There have been concerns, however, that lawmakers might also reevaluate the central bank's role. Its Governor Perry Warjiyo has acknowledged there had been talks about the central bank's mandate in those parliamentary discussions, but no changes were expected. BI's mandate is currently supporting sustainable economic growth along with maintaining the stability of the rupiah currency and prices. Indonesian financial markets fell sharply earlier this week, pressured by concerns over the government's fiscal strategy and growth prospects.

GOLD/FOREX DUBAI 23°C PRAYER TIMES YOUR MONEY YOUR MONEY DUBAI COST CALCULATOR SAVING AND INVESTMENT BUDGET LIVING TAXATION COMMUNITY TIPS CRYPTOCURRENCY EXPLAINER Peso rises to Php57.248 vs US dollar: Winners and losers As local currency appreciates OFW families get less for each dollar sent home Last updated: March 17, 2025 | 14:42 Jay Hilotin , Senior Assistant Editor 3 MIN READ A raft of global and domestic news helped buoy the Philippine peso vs the US dollar in recent days. Gulf News | Jay Hilotin Manila: The Philippine peso closed at Php57.248 against the US dollar on Monday (March 17, 2025) its best in nearly five months since October. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) data show the peso has so far averaged Php57.488 in March against the US greenback, up from Php58.094 average in February, Php58.391 in January and Php58.448 in December 2024. What's behind the rise Amid a raft of global and domestic developments that supported the Asian currency, the Philippine peso finished the first week of March on a strong note against the US dollar. The US dollar slid against other Asian currencies recently, the peso included, following Trump’s announcement to delay the 25 per cent tariff on Canadian and Mexican goods and services that are covered by the North American Free Trade Agreement or USMCA until April 2, 2025, when Trump plans reciprocal tariffs. After the ripple effects of Donald Trump’s presidency rattled markets, the peso emerging as one of the hardest-hit currencies. The peso was flirting with the Php60-per-dollar mark, keeping analysts on edge. With forecasts predicting a dive to this level by midyear — something straight out of the financial history books — it’s been a wild ride for the currency. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Barclays Plc, and Fitch Solutions foresee this breaking point, while DBS Group Holdings Ltd. warns it could dip even further to Php60.8. Recent developments Despite the recent developments surrounding the Manila arrest and extradition to the Hague of former president Rodrigo Duterte, the country's financial sector has shown some resilients. Recently the BSP reported growth in universal and commercial bank loans growth going at its fastest clip in two years. In a dramatic turn for the Philippine financial sector, bank lending skyrocketed by 12.8 per cent in January 2025, marking its fastest growth in two years, according to BSP data. Adding to the momentous news, the Philippines has officially broken free from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) "grey list", shedding the shadow of increased monitoring after nearly four years. The grey list, a red flag for global investors, signalled concerns over the country’s efforts to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and financial crimes. First placed on the list in June 2021, the Philippines has since fought to overhaul its financial safeguards. The BSP now hails the country’s exit as proof of its strengthened defenses against illicit finance, a milestone that restores international confidence in the nation’s banking system. What a stronger peso means With lending on the rise and a more robust regulatory environment, the Philippine economy is charging ahead — leaving its troubled past behind. A stronger peso benefits import-heavy businesses and consumers but can hurt exporters, OFWs, and industries that rely on dollar earnings. The BP) monitors exchange rates to keep a balance and avoid extreme fluctuations. Winners & losers When the Philippine peso appreciates against the US dollar , it means the peso strengthens, and fewer pesos are needed to buy one dollar. This has several effects on different sectors of the economy: Winners Importers and consumers – Imported goods (e.g., oil, electronics, raw materials) become cheaper, lowering costs for businesses and consumers. Government debt payments – If the government has foreign debt in dollars, it becomes cheaper to pay back in pesos. Travellers and students abroad – Filipinos studying or traveling abroad spend less on foreign expenses. Losers OFW Families – Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) sending remittances receive fewer pesos per dollar, reducing family purchasing power. BPO Sector – Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) companies earn in dollars but pay expenses in pesos, reducing profits. Exporters – Philippine products become more expensive for foreign buyers, potentially reducing sales. Tourism Industry – Foreign tourists find it more expensive to visit the Philippines, possibly reducing tourism revenue.

Article Content:
Audio By Carbonatix The High Court (Human Rights Division) has overturned the Bank of Ghana’s (BoG) decision to revoke the operating licence of Ideal Finance Limited. Delivered on Monday, March 10, the ruling marks a major victory for the once-defunct financial institution in its ongoing battle against the central bank. The court concluded that the Bank of Ghana had failed to follow the appropriate legal procedures before revoking Ideal Finance’s licence, rendering the action unjustified. As a result, the court has effectively restored the company’s legal standing, allowing it to resume operations. The Bank of Ghana had revoked Ideal Finance’s licence as part of its comprehensive financial sector cleanup initiative, citing insolvency and poor governance as the primary reasons for its action. However, the High Court found that the BoG did not exhaust the required processes before making its decision, leading to the quashing of the revocation. On August 16, 2019, the Bank of Ghana revoked the operating licences of 23 financial institutions, including Ideal Finance, GN Savings and Loans, First Allied Savings and Loans, Midland Savings and Loans, and Unicredit Savings and Loans. The central bank justified its sweeping measures by stating that these institutions had remained insolvent despite being given sufficient time to recapitalise. The BoG’s financial sector cleanup exercise was aimed at restoring stability and confidence in the banking system, particularly after concerns over the sustainability of certain institutions. However, the cleanup led to the closure of numerous banks and financial companies, leaving depositors and other stakeholders in financial turmoil. While the Bank of Ghana’s actions were intended to strengthen the industry in the long term, they have faced significant opposition from affected institutions and their clients. Ideal Finance’s successful challenge to the revocation could set a precedent for other legal battles, raising questions about the transparency and fairness of the central bank’s regulatory procedures. The High Court’s decision to quash the revocation of Ideal Finance’s licence could have wider ramifications for the Bank of Ghana’s future actions within the financial sector.

Decrease font size Increase font size Print this page Parliamentary Replies Published Date: 10 March 2025 Oral reply to Parliamentary Question on the talent shortage in Singapore's financial sector Date: For Parliament Sitting on 10 March 2025 Name and Constituency of Member of Parliament Mr Yip Hon Weng, MP, Yio Chu Kang SMC Question To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance in light of the current talent shortage in Singapore's financial sector (a) how does the Ministry ensure that efforts to attract foreign talent are balanced with the development and progression of the local workforce in the financial sector; (b) what measures are in place to maintain such balance in this sector; and (c) how does the Ministry monitor their effectiveness. Answer by Mr Alvin Tan, Minister of State, Ministry of Trade and Industry and Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, and Board member of MAS, on behalf of Mr Gan Kim Yong, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry, and Chairman of MAS: 1. MAS is committed to developing our financial sector’s local workforce while being open to complementary foreign manpower. Working closely with industry, we invest heavily in building skills and capabilities in our local workforce, to enable our locals to take up good jobs in the financial sector. As a leading regional and global financial centre, Singapore must continue to attract high quality talent, both locally and from abroad, in order to stay competitive. 2. This balanced approach has been key to Singapore’s success as a global financial centre. We are now a leading financial centre in Asia and the third most competitive globally Based on the 2024 Global Financial Centre Index . . We are home to over 2,500 licensed financial institutions and employ close to 200,000 people. Over 80% of our financial sector Financial sector refers to Financial & Insurance Services (SSIC2020 K64-66) excluding holding companies. workforce is local, and the sector offers the highest median gross income amongst employed locals. Over 2018 to 2023, the financial sector workforce grew by more than 25,000, of which more than 9 out of 10 of the net jobs created went to locals. 3. To help locals acquire skills and capabilities to take on good jobs in the financial sector, MAS has committed $400 million from 2021 to 2025 to support the training of local finance professionals at each stage of their careers. a) At pre-entry and entry levels, MAS provides funding support for internships, apprenticeships, and job rotation programmes, to equip our polytechnic and university students and fresh graduates with the skills to take on jobs in our financial sector. b) At mid-career level, MAS provides opportunities for finance professionals to upskill and reskill. We work with training providers to develop relevant courses, subsidise course fees and develop career conversion programmes with financial institutions for our mid-careers. c) At the senior-level, MAS supports the development of senior leaders through overseas postings, leadership programmes and by building leadership networks. 4. Financial institutions also recognise the importance of developing local talent to meet their manpower needs. For instance, in 2024, OCBC launched OCBC Ignite, an accelerated career programme that comprises an internship and apprenticeship on full time employment with the bank. OCBC Ignite aims to benefit 500 polytechnic students and graduates over three years. UBS also partnered government to develop the UBS-SUPER programme in 2020, and has trained over 400 fresh graduates and mid-career professionals. UBS has also doubled the number of Singaporeans sent on overseas postings, compared to pre-COVID levels. 5. To balance the need to develop the local workforce with the importance of attracting high quality global talent, MAS closely monitors the overall workforce profile of our financial sector as well as the workforce composition of key financial institutions. MAS regularly engages senior management of key financial institutions on their workforce needs and composition, and on how MAS can work with them to develop local talent. MOM’s Complementarity Assessment Framework (COMPASS) for Employment Pass applications encourages firms to support local employment by awarding points based on locals’ share of PMET roles in the firm. COMPASS also recognises and gives additional weight to global talent who bring in skills in shortage, while the Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass (ONE Pass) attracts and anchors top global talent from around the world. 6. We will continue to strike a delicate balance – ensuring our financial institutions have access to high quality foreign talent, while steadfastly developing our local talent pipeline. By maintaining this balance, we will attract more investments and provide good jobs, career choices and progression opportunities for our locals. * * *

Title: Financial conditions index essential for assessing predictive potential of Qatar non - hydrocarbons , says IMF paper
Date: 20250309T183000Z
URL: https://www.gulf-times.com/article/701638/business/financial-conditions-index-essential-for-assessing-predictive-potential-of-qatars-non-hydrocarbons-says-imf-paper

Article Content:
A financial conditions index (FCI) is imperative for Qatar to assess the current state of financial conditions and evaluate the relationship between financial indicators and future growth distribution, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). "The FCI is an important leading indicator of Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon growth, highlighting its predictive potential for future economic performance," said the IMF working paper, which developed an FCI for Qatar and used the growth-at-risk (GaR) framework to examine the impact of financial conditions on Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon growth. As Qatar seeks to enhance the financial sector's contribution to growth through the third financial sector strategy (FSS3), the paper said an FCI will be essential for assessing the current state of financial conditions and evaluating the relationship between financial indicators and future growth distribution. Highlighting that the analysis showed that the FCI is an important leading indicator of Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon growth and closely follows the Qatar Central Bank's (QCB) bank's lending survey; the IMF paper said the FCI exhibits a relatively strong correlation with real non-hydrocarbon GDP (gross domestic product) growth, highlighting its predictive potential for future economic performance. Additionally, the credit conditions component of the FCI aligns with the QCB’s bank lending survey, indicating consistency of its FCI with other surveys. The GaR analysis highlights the importance of domestic and external conditions as indicators of real non-hydrocarbon GDP growth performance, it said, adding domestic conditions seem to offer the strongest signal in the short term, whereas the effects of external conditions are significant in both the short and medium term. "Overall, the current downside risks to Qatar’s baseline non-hydrocarbon growth projections are relatively mild. Alternative scenario tests indicate that future non-hydrocarbon growth could improve following a reduction in the policy deposit rate. Additionally, non-hydrocarbon growth is primarily influenced by oil prices, with minimal effects stemming from global financial market uncertainty," it said. Finding that financial conditions play a significant role in shaping business cycle fluctuations as they reflect both the feedback of current and past economic conditions and markets’ expectations about the economic outlook; it said FCIs are constructed from a broader combination of domestic and external financial conditions. They serve as tools that facilitate a deeper understanding of macro-financial linkages, as well as enable historical assessments by comparing the current state of financial conditions against their past cycles. Stressing that developing the FCI has become even more important as the country aims to further develop the financial sector through the FSS3. The paper, authored by Dorothy Nampewo, said in Qatar, the financial sector plays an important role in shaping economic activity, and therefore serves as a key pillar in fostering the country's sustainable economic development. The FSS3 aims to enhance innovation and diversification in the financial sector, and to support the country’s goal to become a global financial services centre. The FCI would be important in assessing the current state of financial health, gauging the impact of initiatives aimed at fostering financial market deepening, and evaluating the nexus between financial indicators and the distribution of future growth.

Business Banking & Finance Researcher proposes efficient financial software development in cloud environment Listen Listen Text Size Print The paper, authored by Shin Dae-min, a senior researcher at the Financial Security Institute, is published in Computer Standards & Interfaces, an international journal indexed in Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE). Courtesy of Financial Security Institute By Jun Ji-hye Published Feb 28, 2025 9:53 am KST Updated Mar 4, 2025 2:46 pm KST Shin Dae-min, a senior researcher at the Financial Security Institute’s (FSI) personal information protection department, has proposed efficient development and operation strategies for financial software while minimizing security threats in cloud environments in his recent paper. His study has gained attention as the financial sector is increasingly adopting cloud computing, yet security systems and technologies remain tailored to traditional infrastructures, highlighting the need for improvements. Shin Dae-min, senior researcher at Financial Security Institute / Courtesy of Financial Security Institute His paper, “Enhancing Cloud-Native DevSecOps: A Zero Trust Approach for the Financial Sector,” was published in Computer Standards & Interfaces, an international journal indexed in Science Citation Index Expanded. In the study, Shin proposed a new security framework that integrates DevSecOps, which unifies software development (Dev), security (Sec) and operations (Ops), with zero trust, a model that continuously verifies all users and devices without assuming trust. The study was highly regarded for its concrete proposals on how financial institutions can minimize security threats in cloud environments while efficiently developing and operating financial software, the FSI noted. Shin said in an email interview with The Korea Times that the study’s findings could serve as a foundational resource for enhancing cloud-native security in the financial sector and facilitating the practical adoption of the zero-trust security model. “The findings may be considered as a security compliance standard for cloud-native DevSecOps environments in the financial sector. They can also serve as a foundational reference when establishing security assessment criteria and evaluation standards,” he said. “Additionally, the research can be used as a review resource for implementing the cloud native access point model in financial cloud environments, ensuring secure access between internal and external networks, and adopting zero trust network access-based access control.” FSI CEO Park Sang-won underscored that the institution will continue to enhance employees’ expertise, strengthen security standards in the financial sector and lead the way in safe digital innovation. “We will actively support research on emerging security technologies such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing, as well as participation in world-class hacking competitions,” Park said.

Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure . Retail vs. commercial banking​: What's the difference? While both offer similar services, there are some key differences, too. Yahoo Personal Finance · d3sign via Getty Images E Emily Batdorf February 25, 2025 4 min read As an individual or business owner, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by all the banking options out there. Understanding the differences between retail and commercial banking can help. Retail banking targets individual consumers, offering products like deposit accounts and loans. On the other hand, commercial banks serve businesses, governmental bodies, and institutions. Importantly, some banks offer retail and commercial banking, catering to both types of customers. Read on to learn more about retail and commercial banking, as well as key differences between the two. What is retail banking? Retail banking encompasses the banking products and services geared toward “retail” customers or individual consumers. You may also hear retail banking referred to as consumer banking or personal banking. If you have a personal checking or savings account, you’re a customer of a retail bank. Retail banking is available at several types of institutions, from small community banks and credit unions to large national banks. At these larger banks, retail banking may be one division of the larger bank’s offerings. You can also access retail banking through online banks. Read more: These are the 20 biggest banks in the U.S. Because retail banking serves individual customers rather than large corporations, it often involves smaller transactions and tends to be less profitable than commercial banking. Retail banking products and services Retail banking includes a range of products and services aimed at helping consumers manage their money. Common examples include: Deposit accounts: Retail banking customers can open checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs). These accounts provide a secure place to save, earn interest, receive deposits, and more. Mortgages: Many retail banks provide mortgages, home equity loans, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) to individuals purchasing homes or those wanting to borrow against their home equity. Loans and lines of credit: Retail banks may offer several types of loans, including personal loans, auto loans, and student loans. These loans help qualified customers finance a range of expenses. Credit cards: Many banks offer a variety of credit cards, which allow customers to borrow, earn rewards, and take advantage of purchase protection. Investments and insurance: You may be able to open investment accounts — such as IRAs and health savings accounts (HSAs) — and purchase investments from retail banks. And some offer insurance policies too. Branch access: Some retail banks have a network of branches to serve customers in person. On the other hand, some banks operate entirely online. Online and mobile banking: Many retail banks cater to online users with robust mobile and desktop banking platforms. These tools let you view your balances, make transfers, pay bills, deposit checks, and more. Read more: 10 best mobile banking apps of 2025 What is commercial banking? Commercial banking, sometimes referred to as corporate banking, refers to the banking products and services catered to corporations, businesses, and government organizations. Commercial banks may even serve a specific business type, model, or industry. Because commercial banking serves large corporate bodies, its products and services differ from those of retail banking. (However, commercial banks may have retail banking divisions catering to individuals and businesses.) Many large national banks — like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America — offer commercial banking services. But smaller regional banks and credit unions can offer these services too. Due to its customer base, commercial banking typically involves larger transactions, loans, and fees compared to retail banking. Read more: Community bank vs. credit union: Key differences Commercial banking products and services Common commercial banking products and services may include: Deposit accounts: Like individual consumers, businesses need checking and savings accounts to help them save, manage money, and pay bills. Credit and financing: Commercial banks offer business credit cards, loans, and other types of financing that allow businesses to grow and expand. International banking: International banking helps businesses and other entities transact across borders, including payment processing, asset management, and investment banking. Treasury management: These services help businesses manage their cash flow, receivables and payables, debt, merchant services, and more. Wealth management: Like retail banking, commercial banking can also include wealth management services, such as succession planning, retirement planning, and trust services.

Retail vs. commercial banking: Key differences Though retail and commercial banking have many similarities, they also differ in several ways. The following is a look at some key differences between them. Customers Retail banking caters to individual customers, while commercial banking caters to small and large businesses, corporations, and government entities. Products and services Retail banks typically offer deposit accounts, loans, credit cards, and investment accounts. Meanwhile, commercial banking offers all of this, plus international banking, Treasury management, and more. Transaction value Because retail banking caters to individuals, this type of banking typically deals in smaller transactions. Commercial banking, on the other hand, often facilitates much larger transactions at a larger scale. Purpose While retail banking assists individuals in borrowing, saving, and building wealth, commercial banks offer products and services aimed at facilitating business growth. Profitability Retail banks are generally less profitable than commercial banks for several reasons. First, as mentioned above, retail banks deal with smaller transactions compared to commercial banks. Second, many retail banks operate a wide network of brick-and-mortar branches, which can cut into profitability.

He emphasised that financial entities have a duty to ensure that customers fully understand the risks associated with leveraged products and speculative investing. While RBI along with other financial sector regulators is taking progressive steps to educate the customers, financial sector entities also need to shoulder part of the responsibility, Rao said. Absence of financial literacy leads people to fall prey to unscrupulous players which erodes the trust of the people in the system, he added. Also read: Kotak Mahindra Prime appoints Shahrukh Todiwala as new MD, CEO While technology and digital innovations are driving financial inclusion and access, they also bring with them the risk of excessive exposure and over-leveraging, which can create significant vulnerabilities for both individuals and the broader financial system, cautioned Rao. He noted that lenders must be aware of the risk of reckless financialisation. “Increased financial literacy will help increase trust in the sector and its participants, whose benefits will accrue to the entities themselves,” he said.

Advertisement Banking & finance Business Markets China’s DeepSeek-led AI revolution could boost financial sector profit by up to 13%: UBS Lower labour costs as a result of AI could boost profits of brokerages by 8 per cent and insurance firms by 13 per cent, analyst Craig Cao says Reading Time: 2 minutes Why you can trust SCMP Yuke Xie in Beijing Published: 7:30pm, 19 Feb 2025 The recent breakthroughs in China’s artificial intelligence (AI) technology, as exemplified by DeepSeek, will bolster profits of the AI-intensive financial sector as it substantially reduces labour costs, according to UBS. Advertisement With every 10 per cent decrease in labour costs brought about by generative AI, the brokerage industry could see an 8 per cent increase in net profit, and the insurance industry could receive a 13 per cent boost, Craig Cao, a financial analyst at UBS Securities, said during a webinar on Wednesday. The Swiss bank expects valuations of brokerage and insurance stocks to rise by as much as 21 and 18 per cent, respectively, this year. “AI is fundamentally disruptive, especially for [large language model]-intensive jobs,” Cao said. “When comparing across industries, the financial sector remains the leader in language-based roles.” UBS is bullish on the prospects of Chinese brokerage and insurance stocks. Photo: Reuters DeepSeek-R1, an open-source reasoning model released by the Hangzhou-based start-up on January 20, has made waves in China and abroad as it showed capabilities comparable to those of models from OpenAI, Anthropic and Google, but with significantly lower training costs. Advertisement Cao said that while the current implementation rate of generative AI across all industries was less than 10 per cent, the use cases in financial institutions accounted for as much as 37 per cent of the total in 2023 and 2024.

By Nkhensani Nkhwashu , ITWeb portals journalist. Johannesburg, 19 Feb 2025 Nolwazi Hlophe, senior specialist: fintech at the Financial Sector Conduct Authority, emphasised the importance of human integration in AI systems, particularly in finance. The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the financial sector has brought about unprecedented benefits, including enhanced operational efficiency and improved decision-making. However, as AI systems become more autonomous, the need for human oversight has become more critical than ever, according to Nolwazi Hlophe, senior specialist: fintech at the Financial Sector Conduct Authority. Hlophe was speaking at the recent ITWeb AI Summit, where she emphasised the importance of human integration in AI systems, particularly in finance. While AI has the potential to revolutionise the financial industry, over-automating AI systems can lead to inefficiencies and risks. Without human oversight, AI systems may raise false alarms, miss critical transactions or perpetuate biases and discrimination. In finance, where trust and accountability are paramount, human intervention is essential to ensure that AI systems operate ethically and responsibly, noted Hlophe. She highlighted the importance of the "human-in-the-loop” (HITL) approach, which integrates human feedback at various stages of AI and machine learning development processes. “This approach enables human experts to correct errors, provide labelled data and validate AI outputs, thereby enhancing the accuracy, reliability and adaptability of AI systems.” Applications of human-in-the-loop in finance Hlophe said the benefits of HITL approaches are evident in various financial applications, including fraud detection, credit scoring and chatbot customer service. In fraud detection, AI might raise false alarms as opposed to picking up real fraudulent transactions, and this is where a human being will come in to monitor that exchange, noted Hlophe. “Credit applications and scoring are particularly vulnerable to bias and discrimination, making human oversight crucial for maintaining trust in the financial system. Additionally, human-in-the-loop approaches have proven valuable in chatbot-based customer service, where complex queries require human intervention.” See also Bridging the digital divide: Why African languages must be included in AI #ITWebAI2025: Tech leaders urge patience, perspective, preparation with AI To ensure effective human oversight in AI systems, Hlophe recommended the following best practices, defining clear roles and responsibilities by ensuring that both AI systems and human operators understand these: Utilise advanced tools and technologies: Implement tools that facilitate seamless interaction between humans and AI, such as user-friendly dashboards and real-time monitoring systems. These technologies enhance the efficiency of human oversight. Invest in training and development: Provide comprehensive training programmes for financial professionals to enhance their understanding of AI systems and interpret AI outputs effectively. Establish continuous feedback mechanisms: Create processes for ongoing feedback from human operators to improve AI models. “We need to make sure that we work together with this technology to improve its function and its outcomes.” Share

Share We recently published a list of 12 Best Financial Sector Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now In this article, we are going to take a look at where Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) stands against other best financial sector dividend stocks to buy right now. In 2024, financial stocks have led the market, delivering one of the strongest performances among all sectors. While the broader financial sector is expected to continue its upward trajectory, certain stocks within the group appear even better positioned for growth. The broader market’s financial sector has climbed nearly 30% this year, surpassing the overall market and even outperforming the technology sector, which includes many of the high-profile mega-cap tech stocks. The financial index is up by over 7% since the start of 2025. The US banking sector continued to expand in the third quarter of 2024, despite sluggish loan growth. The industry saw a 1.4% sequential increase in total assets during the period. Collectively, the 50 largest US banks added $377.22 billion in aggregate assets during the third quarter, with 35 institutions reporting growth, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. This marked a turnaround from the second quarter when the top 50 banks saw a combined decline of $128.01 billion from the first quarter of the year. The report further mentioned that as of September 30, the total assets of the 50 largest US banks stood at $23.985 trillion. Among the 39 banks with assets ranging from $50 billion to $500 billion, 25 recorded an increase in assets during the third quarter. READ ALSO: 10 Low PE High Dividend Stocks to Buy Now Financial stocks experienced a sharp and widespread rally following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election. This surge was largely fueled by market optimism surrounding a potentially more relaxed regulatory environment in 2025, particularly in relation to mergers and acquisitions. In November, the median total return for the 211 banks tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence climbed to 13.4%, significantly outpacing the broader market’s 5.9% gain. Another key factor influencing bank performance was the Federal Reserve’s release of parameters for its annual industry stress test. The 2025 test outlined less severe economic shocks than previous years, although it still projected a rise in U.S. unemployment to 10% and a 33% decline in home prices. Compared to prior tests, the latest scenario included milder increases in joblessness and less drastic drops in stock and real estate values. Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg emphasized these adjustments in his report, “2025 Stress Test: Scenarios Easier than Past Two Years.” Meanwhile, Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala suggested that the test’s reduced stringency and greater predictability could lead banks to hold smaller capital buffers later in the year. The financial sector is cyclical, meaning its performance is closely tied to the overall health of the economy. The US economy has maintained steady momentum, increasing the likelihood of a “soft landing”—a scenario that would help ease concerns about a potential mild recession that could weigh on financial stocks. According to analysts, a key shift heading into 2025 compared to previous years is the outlook for interest rates. The second half of 2024 marked the start of a new rate cycle, with the Federal Reserve implementing its first rate cut since the early stages of the pandemic. For banks, interest rate changes present both opportunities and challenges. While higher rates can boost net interest margins, rate fluctuations can also impact lending activity and overall profitability. Investor enthusiasm for financial stocks is on the rise, driven in large part by their appealing dividend payouts. According to a report by Janus Henderson, the financial sector saw headline growth of 7.7% growth in dividend payouts on a YoY basis. The report also mentioned that the industry paid $72 billion in dividends in the third quarter of 2024. Our Methodology For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and identified dividend stocks from the finance sector. These companies offer a wide range of financial services, including banking, insurance, investment management, and financial planning. The stocks mentioned below also offer stable dividend yields. From the resultant list, we picked 12 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors and ranked them in ascending order of hedge funds’ sentiment towards them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. ( see more details here ). A panoramic view of a financial institution, representing the number of corporations who trust the company’s services. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55 Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is a global financial services company that offers a wide range of related services and products to its consumers. Recently, the company has focused on growing its wealth management division, strengthening its technological infrastructure, and ensuring financial stability to align with changing regulations. Its progress has been fueled by efforts to enhance client services through technological innovation while managing asset expansion and effectively addressing regulatory challenges and risks. The stock has soared by almost 61% over the past year. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) posted revenue of $16.2 billion, marking a 25% increase from the same period a year earlier. Net income climbed to $3.7 billion, or $2.22 per diluted share, compared to $1.5 billion, or $0.85 per share, in the previous year. Total client assets in Wealth and Investment Management reached $7.9 trillion, driven by strong market performance and solid net inflows. The company remains focused on four core pillars—strategy, culture, financial strength, and growth—to support its Integrated Firm model and drive long-term value for shareholders. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) remained committed to returning value to shareholders, as the company paid $150 million to investors through dividends in the most recent quarter. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.925 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.66%, as of February 16. Overall, MS ranks 10th on our list of best financial sector dividend stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential for MS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Share We recently published a list of 12 Best Financial Sector Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now In this article, we are going to take a look at where Truist Financial Corporation (NYSE:TFC) stands against other best financial sector dividend stocks to buy right now. In 2024, financial stocks have led the market, delivering one of the strongest performances among all sectors. While the broader financial sector is expected to continue its upward trajectory, certain stocks within the group appear even better positioned for growth. The broader market’s financial sector has climbed nearly 30% this year, surpassing the overall market and even outperforming the technology sector, which includes many of the high-profile mega-cap tech stocks. The financial index is up by over 7% since the start of 2025. The US banking sector continued to expand in the third quarter of 2024, despite sluggish loan growth. The industry saw a 1.4% sequential increase in total assets during the period. Collectively, the 50 largest US banks added $377.22 billion in aggregate assets during the third quarter, with 35 institutions reporting growth, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. This marked a turnaround from the second quarter when the top 50 banks saw a combined decline of $128.01 billion from the first quarter of the year. The report further mentioned that as of September 30, the total assets of the 50 largest US banks stood at $23.985 trillion. Among the 39 banks with assets ranging from $50 billion to $500 billion, 25 recorded an increase in assets during the third quarter. Also read: 10 Low PE High Dividend Stocks to Buy Now Financial stocks experienced a sharp and widespread rally following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election. This surge was largely fueled by market optimism surrounding a potentially more relaxed regulatory environment in 2025, particularly in relation to mergers and acquisitions. In November, the median total return for the 211 banks tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence climbed to 13.4%, significantly outpacing the broader market’s 5.9% gain. Another key factor influencing bank performance was the Federal Reserve’s release of parameters for its annual industry stress test. The 2025 test outlined less severe economic shocks than previous years, although it still projected a rise in U.S. unemployment to 10% and a 33% decline in home prices. Compared to prior tests, the latest scenario included milder increases in joblessness and less drastic drops in stock and real estate values. Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg emphasized these adjustments in his report, “2025 Stress Test: Scenarios Easier than Past Two Years.” Meanwhile, Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala suggested that the test’s reduced stringency and greater predictability could lead banks to hold smaller capital buffers later in the year. The financial sector is cyclical, meaning its performance is closely tied to the overall health of the economy. The US economy has maintained steady momentum, increasing the likelihood of a “soft landing”—a scenario that would help ease concerns about a potential mild recession that could weigh on financial stocks.

This surge was largely fueled by market optimism surrounding a potentially more relaxed regulatory environment in 2025, particularly in relation to mergers and acquisitions. In November, the median total return for the 211 banks tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence climbed to 13.4%, significantly outpacing the broader market’s 5.9% gain. Another key factor influencing bank performance was the Federal Reserve’s release of parameters for its annual industry stress test. The 2025 test outlined less severe economic shocks than previous years, although it still projected a rise in U.S. unemployment to 10% and a 33% decline in home prices. Compared to prior tests, the latest scenario included milder increases in joblessness and less drastic drops in stock and real estate values. Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg emphasized these adjustments in his report, “2025 Stress Test: Scenarios Easier than Past Two Years.” Meanwhile, Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala suggested that the test’s reduced stringency and greater predictability could lead banks to hold smaller capital buffers later in the year. The financial sector is cyclical, meaning its performance is closely tied to the overall health of the economy. The US economy has maintained steady momentum, increasing the likelihood of a “soft landing”—a scenario that would help ease concerns about a potential mild recession that could weigh on financial stocks. According to analysts, a key shift heading into 2025 compared to previous years is the outlook for interest rates. The second half of 2024 marked the start of a new rate cycle, with the Federal Reserve implementing its first rate cut since the early stages of the pandemic. For banks, interest rate changes present both opportunities and challenges. While higher rates can boost net interest margins, rate fluctuations can also impact lending activity and overall profitability. Investor enthusiasm for financial stocks is on the rise, driven in large part by their appealing dividend payouts. According to a report by Janus Henderson, the financial sector saw headline growth of 7.7% growth in dividend payouts on a YoY basis. The report also mentioned that the industry paid $72 billion in dividends in the third quarter of 2024.

India needs to add USD 4 trn in bank capital to meet 'Viksit Bharat' GDP target: Report ANI | Updated: Feb 11, 2025 09:10 IST ANI News Join our Whatsapp channel New Delhi [ India ], February 11 (ANI): India 's banking sector will need to raise USD 4 trillion in capital over the next two decades to support the country's goal of becoming a developed economy, or "Viksit Bharat," by 2047, according to a report by HSBC Mutual Fund. The report highlighted that for India to achieve its ambitious target, its financial and banking assets must grow at a much faster rate than GDP . The country's GDP , which stood at USD 3.4 trillion in 2023, is projected to expand nearly nine times to USD 30 trillion by 2047. To support this economic expansion, financial assets--valued at USD 6.4 trillion in 2023--need to grow almost 19 times to USD 120 trillion by 2047. Similarly, banking assets, currently at USD 3.1 trillion, are expected to surge to USD 45 trillion, marking a 14.5-times increase. It said " India 's banking industry will need to add USD 4 trn in capital in the next 2 decades to create the multiplier effect to reach the Viksit Bharat GDP target". A well-developed financial sector plays a critical role in supporting economic growth by providing credit, investments, and other financial services. The report noteD that India 's financial sector must expand significantly to match the scale of other major economies. At present, the U.S. leads with USD 135 trillion in financial assets, followed by China at USD 78 trillion and Germany at USD 21 trillion. India 's financial sector, though much smaller today, will need to grow rapidly to sustain the country's economic ambitions. The banking sector, in particular, will require a significant infusion of capital--around USD 4 trillion over the next 20 years. This capital will be essential in creating a multiplier effect, which will help boost business investments, industrial growth, and infrastructure development. A strong banking system will also enhance global confidence in India 's economy, attracting more foreign investment. The report also projected that India 's GDP could nearly double to USD 7 trillion by 2030 from USD 3.4 trillion currently. However, sustaining high growth for the next two decades will be the real challenge. If India successfully expands its financial sector at the required pace, it will not only reach the USD 30 trillion GDP target but also emerge as a key player in the global economy by 2047. (ANI)

Speaking on Morning Starr with Lantam Papanko, Dr. Atuahene argued that those seeking justice should direct their concerns to the Attorney General's office rather than looking to the IMF for intervention. "This case started in 2017. After 2020, are you saying that the previous Attorney General didn't see anything wrong with it? Why couldn't he have prosecuted it? People make a lot of noise, but if they had a solid case, they should be asking the Attorney General why it wasn't pursued," he said. He further emphasized that Ghana's Limitation Act, NRCD 575, places time restrictions on legal actions, with some cases having a statute of limitations of three, five, or thirty years. He warned that prolonged delays could make it legally impossible to prosecute certain financial crimes. Amid discussions about petitioning the IMF over banking sector issues, Dr. Atuahene dismissed the move as ineffective. "The IMF is not in this country to arbitrate on these matters. They are only here because we are taking their money. Reporting to them won't change anything because it's not part of their mandate," he explained. With the IMF delegation expected in Ghana next week, he noted that their focus would be on broader economic assessments, not unresolved financial sector cases. Dr. Atuahene also touched on the ongoing transition at the Bank of Ghana , stating that the acting governor must first gather financial sector data before being confirmed by the Council of State. He urged stakeholders to be more circumspect in their accusations, suggesting that earlier due diligence could have prevented the current predicament. "If we had done the right thing from the start, would we be having this conversation today?" he asked.

Speaking on Morning Starr with Lantam Papanko, Dr. Atuahene questioned the discrepancies in reported bailout figures and urged a thorough scrutiny of the sector. "The reason I want the new government to act when they take over is to conduct a forensic audit of the amount that was reportedly used for the bailout," he stated. He pointed out that while government sources claimed GH¢21 billion was spent on the banking cleanup and GH¢25 billion on the financial sector, official records from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2019 reflected only GH¢12.7 billion. Dr. Atuahene urged Dr. Johnson Asiama, a key figure in the new administration, to take a critical approach and not accept reported figures at face value. "He must act like the Minister of Roads. He must conduct a forensic audit of every cost item—everything that has happened, including the remittances," he emphasized. Highlighting further financial discrepancies, he revealed that Ghana's Economic Summary Report for 2023 stated that the country received GH¢55.1 billion in remittances. However, the Bank of Ghana 's balance sheet only accounted for GH¢2.8 billion, raising concerns about transparency. To ensure impartiality, Dr. Atuahene recommended hiring foreign auditors instead of local ones. "I don't want Ghanaian auditors to handle this. I want foreign auditors to conduct a forensic audit of the entire banking sector cleanup, including legacy issues," he stressed. Beyond the bailout audit, he warned about the financial instability of the Bank of Ghana , which he described as "capital deficient." He disclosed that the previous Minister of Finance had signed an agreement with the IMF requiring a recapitalization plan for the central bank. Given Ghana's limited fiscal space under the IMF program, Dr. Atuahene questioned how the government would secure the necessary funds. "You can't recapitalize the banks and leave the central bank out," he cautioned, urging the new administration to take a holistic approach to financial sector reforms.

Business Business Financial sector crisis, labour unrest flagged as key risks Mon Feb 10, 2025 12:00 AM Last update on: Mon Feb 10, 2025 05:05 AM Star Business Report Mon Feb 10, 2025 12:00 AM Last update on: Mon Feb 10, 2025 05:05 AM Weakness in the financial sector and labour unrest might be the major sources of risk for the interim government in the short term, said a finance ministry report yesterday on Bangladesh's recent economic challenges and the way forward. In view of this, the government should give the highest priority to bringing back discipline in the financial sector and mitigating labour unrest before it flares up, said the paper, presented by Finance Secretary Md Khairuzzaman Mozumder to Chief Adviser (CA) Muhammad Yunus. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. Finance Adviser Salehuddin Ahmed, Bangladesh Bank Governor Ahsan H Mansur, and other senior finance ministry officials were present, according to the press wing of the CA. The paper said factories near the Beximco Group's industrial enclaves are prone to the risk of labour unrest The paper said factories near the Beximco Group's industrial enclaves are prone to the risk of labour unrest because of the layoff of 40,000 workers across the textile and garment units of Beximco. Incidents of labour unrest have been taking place in factories whose owners are absconding on allegations of either corruption or money laundering. The paper said a section of vested groups instigates the workers and students. This often deteriorates law and order and creates public suffering in industrial zones, it added. The financial sector is also at risk because of the massive buildup of default loans. Some 10 banks are at high risk due to mismanagement by the previous government, said the finance ministry paper, adding that authorities have appointed international firms to review the asset quality of banks. At a press briefing after the meeting, Shafiqul Alam, press secretary to the CA, said the chief adviser asked the BB governor to ensure the autonomy of the central bank as soon as possible. The BB has stopped all kinds of fresh recruitment until now, he added. Alam said the government has been trying not to take on any unnecessary and less important projects anymore. Citing the finance ministry paper, he said that major economic indicators are showing positive signs. For instance, exports grew by 10 percent year-on-year, imports were increasing, jobs were being created, and inflation had come down to single digits. Inflation decreased because of the hike in the interest rate, and it is expected that inflation will come down to 7.5 percent by July of this year, said Alam. Furthermore, the government has taken some measures, such as a contractionary monetary policy and a conducive revenue policy, to arrest high inflationary pressure, he added.

Stock heatmap by FinViz.com Tue, 04 Feb 2025 14:46:07 GMT Tech sector consolidation: Software stocks rise amidst mixed market signals 📈 Technology and Software Sector: Signs of Strength The technology sector shows a mixed performance today, highlighted by notable gains in software applications. Salesforce (CRM) stands out with an impressive rise of 2.01%, indicating investor confidence in software solutions. Meanwhile, Oracle (ORCL) leads in software - infrastructure, increasing by 0.78%. These gains suggest a strategic consolidation within tech, driven by software growth. 📉 Semiconductor Sector: Subdued Performance In contrast, the semiconductor sector sees lackluster movements. Nvidia (NVDA) inches up by 0.38%, while Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shows a stronger uptick of 1.84%. Overall, semiconductors struggle to generate momentum, reflecting cautious investor sentiment towards hardware manufacturing. 💼 Financial Sector: Mixed Reactions The financial sector shows varied outcomes. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) lifts the mood with a 0.70% gain. However, significant declines such as PayPal (PYPL), down by 7.63%, weigh heavily on the sector. The mixed financial sector performance could be indicative of broader market volatility and interest rate speculations. 🩺 Healthcare Sector: Notable Declines The healthcare sector faces challenges, with Merck (MRK) taking a sharp downturn of 10.41%. Diversified drug manufacturers like AbbVie (ABBV) also drop by 1.02%, contributing to a sector-wide bearish sentiment potentially linked to regulatory or earnings concerns. 🚀 Overall Market Analysis Despite mixed signals, the tech sector, particularly software stocks, shows pockets of strength, offering investors potential long-term growth opportunities. The semiconductor sector's subdued performance calls for caution, possibly affecting related tech stocks. Investor focus might shift towards companies demonstrating robust software innovation. Financial stocks mirror broader economic uncertainties, with varying results impacting investment strategies. Health sector downturns highlight potential regulatory influences or negative earnings surprises, necessitating careful monitoring by investors. Investors should keep a close eye on the technology sector's evolving dynamics, particularly in software, and consider adjusting portfolios to leverage these trends. Additionally, the mixed performance in financials underscores the importance of diversification.

Title: Bid to attract foreign investors : FEMA rules to be eased further , says DEA Secretary

Article Content:
Secretary, Economic Affairs, Ajay Seth New Delhi: The finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are in talks to further ease foreign exchange rules, especially with regard to non-debt instruments, economic affairs secretary Ajay Seth told ET. He said the exercise focused on simplifying Foreign Exchange Management Act ( FEMA ) regulations and updating them to modern standards will be completed in three-four months. Given that sector-specific limits for foreign direct investment (FDI) have already been substantially relaxed, the government is turning its attention to easing restrictive rules to woo foreign investors . These changes will further liberalise the rules on equity investments, helping India attract more risk capital. Secretary, Economic Affairs, Ajay Seth “The (legislation) was designed with assumptions and economic situations 25 years ago and certainly requires a closer look,” Seth said. Some measures had been initiated after the July 2024 budget and more will follow once the review process is over, he said. Having scaled a peak of almost $85 billion in FY22, total FDI fell over two years to $71 billion in FY24. To be sure, equity FDI has surged 45% on year in the first half of FY25 to $29.8 billion from $20.5 billion. Live Events Regulations for foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were relaxed in November. Their investments would be categorised as FDI once they exceeded the 10% FPI ownership limit in an Indian company. This was done after the July 2024 budget said a simpler foreign investment regime would be put in place. The government had in August 2024 eased crossborder share swaps, allowing the issue or transfer of equity instruments of a local company in exchange for those of a foreign firm. Also, investments by an overseas citizen of India on a non-repatriation basis would not be counted as indirect foreign investment. FACTOR MARKET REFORM Seth said the government will prepare medium-tolong-term plans for land reforms in urban areas, building on the July 2024 budget announcements. Financial sector reforms are also being discussed. “The Financial Stability Development Council (FSDC), which is looking at financial sector reforms, will also look at the capital-side reforms,” Seth said. “These are all work in progress and we have some distance to go.” The FSDC, a platform on which all the financial sector regulators are represented, is headed by the finance minister. BROADER REGULATORY EASING Seth said the expert committee proposed in the February 1 budget to review non-financial sector regulations will examine licences, compliance and inspections among other matters with the broad principle of “trust first and scrutinise later,” as FM Nirmala Sitharaman had said in her speech. He said states are being encouraged to participate in this exercise. Rules in the financial sector are largely driven by the Union government and the relevant watchdogs. However, several non-financial sector regulations are primarily handled by the states, he said. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

Key Points Rapid insurance market expansion fueled by strong economic fundamentals Financial digitisation and increased accessibility driving sector growth Pension sector expected to significantly expand with rising incomes Strategic policy alignment crucial for sustainable financial development New Delhi,, January 31 India's insurance sector is expected to be the fastest-growing market among G20 nations over the next five years (2024-2028), according to the Economic Survey 2024-25 presented in Parliament on Friday. "India's insurance sector is performing well and is projected to become the fastest-growing market among G20 nations - Economic Survey 2024-25" The survey highlighted the sector's strong performance and its growing role in India's financial system. It said "India's insurance sector is performing well and is projected to become the fastest-growing market among G20 nations over the next five years (2024-2028)". The survey highlighted that the rapid expansion of the insurance market is driven by strong economic fundamentals, increasing corporate earnings, and rising institutional investments. Additionally, the sector has benefited from growing inflows from Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), higher financial formalisation, digitisation, and improved accessibility. These factors have strengthened the insurance market, making it a key contributor to India's financial sector growth. Alongside the insurance industry, the pension sector is also expected to grow significantly as India moves from a lower-middle-income to an upper-middle-income country. As income levels rise, more people are likely to invest in pension plans, ensuring long-term financial security. This transition will further deepen India's financial sector and encourage more savings and investments. It added "The pension sector is expected to grow as the economy transitions from a lower-middle-income to an upper middle-income country". The Economic Survey emphasized the need for balancing financial sector development with financialisation as India works towards its economic vision for 2047. It stated that the country must consider household financial savings, investment needs, and levels of financial literacy while designing policies for the financial sector. Ensuring that incentives in the sector align with India's long-term economic goals is essential for sustainable growth. It said "As India strives to align its financial system with its economic aspirations for 2047, she should strive to maintain the fine balance between financial sector development and growth on the one hand and financialisation on the other. With favourable economic conditions, increasing financial awareness, and supportive government policies, India's insurance and pension sectors are set to expand rapidly in the coming years. However, careful planning and policy measures will be crucial to maintaining this growth while ensuring financial stability and inclusion. - ANI India's Insurance Sector: Fastest Growth in G20 Forecast India's insurance sector is set to become the fastest-growing market among G20 nations in the next five years.

India financial regulators need formal impact assessment rules, government report says Published on 01/31/2025 at 04:14 am EST Reuters Share INDIA 10Y Cash +0.018 Indian Rupee / US Dollar (INR/USD) -0.17% MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's financial sector regulators need to put in place a formal process to assess the impact of their regulations, the government's Economic Survey said on Friday. The survey, presented a day ahead of the annual budget, details the state of the economy while flagging longer-term economic and policy issues. Its suggestions and recommendations are not binding. Regulators in the financial sector, such as the Reserve Bank of India, Securities and Exchange Board of India and Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board, are largely left to regulate themselves, the report said. While there are public consultation processes followed before new rules and regulations are formed, "there is a huge potential for improvement in their responsiveness", it added. The report suggested that regulators set up an independent Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) agency internally. The RIA would directly report to the board of the regulator, which includes members from the government and independent directors. This can provide an "impartial and objective assessment of the regulatory processes and outcomes, including the economic and social impacts of regulations," the report said. Such a process would also improve the transparency and responsiveness of regulators, it added. (Reporting by Swati Bhat; Editing by Sonia Cheema) © Reuters - 2025 Share

India's Insurance sector will be the fastest-growing among G-20 nations: Eco Survey ANI | Updated: Jan 31, 2025 14:08 IST ANI News Join our Whatsapp channel New Delhi, [India], January 31 (ANI): India's insurance sector is expected to be the fastest-growing market among G20 nations over the next five years (2024-2028), according to the Economic Survey 2024-25 presented in Parliament on Friday. The survey highlighted the sector's strong performance and its growing role in India's financial system. It said "India's insurance sector is performing well and is projected to become the fastest-growing market among G20 nations over the next five years (2024-2028)". The survey highlighted that the rapid expansion of the insurance market is driven by strong economic fundamentals, increasing corporate earnings, and rising institutional investments. Additionally, the sector has benefited from growing inflows from Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), higher financial formalisation, digitisation, and improved accessibility. These factors have strengthened the insurance market, making it a key contributor to India's financial sector growth. Alongside the insurance industry, the pension sector is also expected to grow significantly as India moves from a lower-middle-income to an upper-middle-income country. As income levels rise, more people are likely to invest in pension plans, ensuring long-term financial security. This transition will further deepen India's financial sector and encourage more savings and investments. It added "The pension sector is expected to grow as the economy transitions from a lower-middle-income to an upper middle-income country". The Economic Survey emphasized the need for balancing financial sector development with financialisation as India works towards its economic vision for 2047. It stated that the country must consider household financial savings, investment needs, and levels of financial literacy while designing policies for the financial sector. Ensuring that incentives in the sector align with India's long-term economic goals is essential for sustainable growth. It said "As India strives to align its financial system with its economic aspirations for 2047, she should strive to maintain the fine balance between financial sector development and growth on the one hand and financialisation on the other. With favourable economic conditions, increasing financial awareness, and supportive government policies, India's insurance and pension sectors are set to expand rapidly in the coming years. However, careful planning and policy measures will be crucial to maintaining this growth while ensuring financial stability and inclusion. (ANI)

Summary The affordable housing finance lender started operations in 2014 as Aspire Home Finance Corp. and has a loan book of ₹ 4,098 crore Gift this article This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Subscribe now Mumbai: Mumbai-based financial services group Motilal Oswal wants to exit the home finance business and has put its housing finance company on the block, three people aware of the matter said. The development comes in the backdrop of increased deal activity in the affordable housing space in the past few months, both from private equity investors and in the primary markets. Motilal Oswal has appointed investment bank Avendus Capital to look for potential buyers, the people cited above added on condition of anonymity. The group’s holding company, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, along with other wholly owned subsidiaries, currently holds 97.49% stake in the housing finance subsidiary, Motilal Oswal Home Finance. Also read | What’s Sebi’s score: Increasing complaints test regulator’s redressal system While it was not immediately known how much the stake might fetch, some of its listed peers in the affordable housing space—such as Aadhar Housing Finance, Aavas Financiers, Aptus Value Housing Finance India, and Home First Finance Company—are trading at 2.8-3.9 times their book value or net worth. As per data from Crisil, Motilal Oswal’s housing finance business had a standalone net worth of ₹ 1,290 crore as on 31 March 2024. Going by peer valuation, back-of-the-envelope calculations show the company could be valued between ₹ 3,612 crore and ₹ 5,031 crore. A spokesperson for Motilal Oswal Home Finance denied the move: “There is no such development of sale of business of Motilal Oswal Home Finance Ltd (MOHFL)". The spokesperson added that the company continually evaluates various business opportunities as part of ongoing strategic efforts, and it would “communicate any relevant updates if there is any such specific development in future". An email sent to Avendus remained unanswered till press time. The numbers The affordable housing finance lender started operations in 2014 as Aspire Home Finance Corp. and was renamed to Motilal Oswal Home Finance in 2019. As of 30 June 2024, it had a loan book of ₹ 4,098 crore, according to Crisil. The loan book size was ₹ 4,048 crore on 31 March 2024. The lender has had its share of asset quality troubles in the past. An August 2021 note by rating agency Icra had pointed out that in FY19, the lender’s gross non-performing assets (NPAs) rose to 9.2% of loans. It said that the Motilal Oswal Group undertook “several remedial measures, including the strengthening of the systems and processes, managerial support, increased oversight, and capital infusion, thereby underscoring its commitment to the venture".

A peer comparison showed that Aadhar Housing Finance and Aptus Value Housing Finance India had gross NPA ratios of 1.3% and 1.25%, respectively, as on 30 September 2024. Meanwhile, Crisil Ratings believes that Motilal Oswal Home Finance remains strategically important to Motilal Oswal Financial Services as it gives the group exposure to the housing finance space. This “imparts diversity to its revenue profile and mitigates the effect of cyclicality inherent to capital-market businesses". In September 2024, Crisil revised its outlook on non-convertible debentures of Motilal Oswal Home Finance to positive from stable. Rising deal activity The decision to put the business on the block comes at a time when private equity investors have taken a keen interest in affordable housing businesses. For instance, Shriram Finance sold its entire 84.44% stake in Shriram Housing Finance to Warburg’s affiliate, Mango Crest Investment, for ₹ 3,929 crore in December 2024. The company has since been rebranded as Truhome Finance. Then, EQT Partners acquired 100% stake in Indo Star Home Finance in September 2024. Earlier, CVC Capital Partners acquired a 26.47% stake in listed Aavas Financiers in August 2024, triggering an open offer for control.

These include investments into Vastu Housing Finance, Vridhi Finserv Home Finance and Shubham Housing Finance. The segment also saw two large IPOs (initial public offerings) last year. At least a few housing finance companies—including Aadhar Housing Finance—pivoted from a sale process in favour of the public markets because of lucrative valuations. Besides Aadhar, Bajaj Housing Finance also went public last year. Affordable homes a bright spot Experts said that the affordable housing segment continues to remain a bright spot supported by rapid urbanization, increasing migration to cities, and a growing middle class, and is likely to continue to be a high growth segment. “This is particularly attractive for non-banks given limited penetration of large banks allowing HFCs (housing finance companies) to generate attractive risk-adjusted yield," said Prakash Agarwal, a partner at debt market advisory firm Gefion Capital Advisors. According to Agarwal, the outlook for the sector continues to remain positive even in the long term and provides enough scope for sustained growth for the players in the segment.

Mint reported on 28 December how mortgage lenders are increasingly looking to finance affordable homes on the back of stiff competition from banks in the prime housing space. The affordable housing loan market in India is estimated at ₹ 13 trillion, with HFCs constituting ₹ 6.9 trillion and banks having a share of ₹ 6.2 trillion, as per National Housing Bank data cited in a joint report from industry lobby body CII and real estate consultancy Knight Frank in December.
