India’s socio-economic development and pathways for sustainable growth require a substantial understanding of its energy requirements. Policymakers must have access to comprehensive and reliable data on the country’s energy scenario to make better-informed decisions for India’s transition to a net-zero emissions economy by 2070. This paper offers a robust database of India’s energy landscape by validating and reconstructing the energy balance (EB) and computing emissions data. Policymakers can utilise this framework to assess the impacts of policy interventions on energy consumption and emissions in the country’s energy transition efforts. PREMIUM As a vulnerable nation, and on the back of solidarity among developing countries to win an agreement on a loss-and-damage financing mechanism, India could urge that attention to the climate crisis is not diluted. (Shutterstock) Key takeaways: · The Energy Balance (EB) is an accounting framework that maps the supply and demand of all forms of energy in a country. It provides data on energy flows in physical and common energy units for comparison. · This study identifies various gaps and inconsistencies in data on India’s energy. It reconstructs and validates these statistics by cross-referencing data from other sources, including relevant ministries, to provide a more representative picture of India’s energy landscape. For example, in this paper, the statistical differences in coal and petroleum products have been minimised by refining conversion factors. · The results of the study reveal trends in energy consumption and emissions from energy combustion. Non-coking coal, primarily used in power generation, has remained the dominant energy resource in India recently and is responsible for approximately 60% of all combustion emissions. Meanwhile, energy from renewable sources has slowly increased its share in total energy supply. · Electrification of machinery is an important step in reducing emissions. This paper presents a framework for estimating the impacts of policies on energy and emissions. It showed that electrification can lead to substantial reductions in emissions, especially when the machinery currently operates on fossil fuels with low efficiencies. A greener power grid would further help reduce emissions in the country. Data on India’s energy resources can be classified as primary or secondary in nature (i.e., if it is available naturally or requires some processing) and renewable or non-renewable. The major energy resources in India include: · Coal: This is the largest contributor to emissions from India’s energy sector. The country has abundant resources which are used for power generation, though higher-grade coking coal is imported for use in the steel industry. · Crude oil and petroleum products: India is highly dependent on crude oil imports to produce petroleum products domestically. Petroleum products contribute significantly to emissions, particularly from the transport sector. Electrification of this sector would result in lower demand for petroleum products, and hence lower import demand of crude oil. · Renewable energy sources: Solar, wind, and hydro are rapidly growing in India’s energy mix and will drive the country’s decarbonisation efforts. · Natural gas: India consumes relatively lower amounts of natural gas, though it is important for non-energy uses, such as feedstock for fertilisers and other manufacturing sectors. 1. Broader and Validated Data Collection: * Disaggregating energy consumption data by type of consumer, state, and household income levels can provide policymakers with a clearer picture of energy access and usage. * Data on biomass usage are important for a comprehensive understanding of the energy landscape in India. * India’s diverse energy landscape requires state-specific energy strategies that consider locally-available resources and consumption patterns. Policies can be tailored to help states meet their unique energy needs while contributing to national climate goals. 2. Electrification and the role of renewables: * Electrification of machinery will help reduce emissions, particularly for less-efficient sectors. * Investments in grid infrastructure and energy storage will help accommodate more renewable energy and make electrification more effective in decarbonisation. 3. Energy losses: * Large energy losses in transmission, distribution, and transformation need to be addressed, and incentives can be provided to help reduce these losses. This study underscores the critical importance of accurate and comprehensive energy statistics for understanding and modelling India’s energy landscape and transition. Through validating, disaggregating, and extending existing energy balances with data on emissions from energy combustion, this study provides a more reliable dataset for policy analysis. As India charts its path towards net-zero emissions, robust energy and emissions data will be essential for designing targeted, inclusive, and sustainable interventions that achieve the country’s long-term goals.

He made the call while setting the context for a panel discussion under the theme, \"Delivering Affordable, Accessible, and Sustainable Energy Solutions for Africa\" during APD 2025 Day 2 at the Accra International Conference Centre on Friday, January 31, 2025. Jinapor stressed the critical role of cooperation among African nations in overcoming the continent's energy challenges and ensuring universal access to electricity. According to him, it is crucial to address Africa’s energy deficit, because \"over 600 million people on the continent still lack access to electricity.\" This shortage, he explained, was a significant barrier to economic growth and poverty reduction, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where energy access is most limited. \"In order to achieve a sustainable energy future, Africa must work together. It is only through collaboration that we can unlock the continent’s full potential, overcome the energy crisis, and drive inclusive development,\" Jinapor added. The energy minister emphasized that Ghana had made strides in improving its energy infrastructure, ensuring that more of the population had access to electricity than many other nations in the region.

    "article_text": "Jump to: The Study The Methods The Results What Does This Mean For Us? Weighted vests have recently seen a huge surge in popularity, and for good reason. Wearing a weighted vest is an easy way to pack some additional strength and conditioning gains into your walks, especially when leg day has given you some heavy DOMS. But the benefits could support our health goals even further, with new evidence showing that weighted walking could increase our energy burn by over 40%. The Study The study published in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise aimed to understand how wearing weighted vests affects energy use while walking and standing. The main purpose of the study was to develop a new model to measure energy use when wearing weighted vest since they distribute weight differently to rucksacks – which were originally studied. The Methods The study included: 20 healthy adults. Participants walking on a treadmill at different speeds while wearing weighted vests loaded with 0%, 22%, 44%, and 66% of their body weight. The researchers measured oxygen use and energy burn using a breathing mask (indirect calorimetry). The Results Carrying heavier weights reduced walking speed. As weight increased, speed decreased. The metabolic rate (calories burned per kilogram) increased as weight increased. A 22% body weight vest increased energy burn by 12.4%, 44% body weight vest increased energy burn by 25.7%, 66% body weight vest increased energy burn by 41.2%. When comparing the expenditure to rucksacks, the study confirmed that weighted vests increase energy use, but the effect is less extreme than rucksacks. For every 10% of body weight added in a rucksack, energy use increases by 19.6%. However, for every 10% of body weight added in a vest, energy use increases by 13.8%. What Does This Mean For Us? While the main purpose of this study was trialling a new testing model to measure energy expenditure, we can use the findings to support other studies available that suggest weighted walking increases energy burn. Walking with a weighted vest increases energy burn because carrying extra weight forces our muscles to work harder. The added load increases oxygen consumption and metabolic demand, making each step more energy intensive. The study found that a vest weighing 66% of body weight increased energy burn by 41.2%. However, energy burn increase depends on weight load and lighter vests have smaller effects. While weighted vests are effective, weighted rucksacks use even more energy due to the extra demand on stabilising muscles. By using a weighted vest during our walks, we could increase energy expenditure. However, it's really important to take note that with additional weight, came a reduction in walking speed , which could potentially negatively effect our energy expenditure during walks. If you have goals of using your weighted walks to increase energy output, use a weight that you can keep a brisk pace with. Start at 10% of your body weight and adjust from there.

News James Rodger Content Editor 16:55, 31 Jan 2025 View Image The think tank examined state energy bill support put in place during the energy crisis of 2022/23. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has slammed the government - saying the Labour Party could have saved £4.5bn by designing energy support schemes better. In its report entitled How should governments help households during an energy crisis?, the think tank examined state energy bill support put in place during the energy crisis of 2022/23. ‌ The schemes \"were poorly targeted and encouraged the overuse of energy,\" they said. The thinktank slammed the Energy Price Guarantee, which capped average annual bills at £2,500,and the Energy Bills Support Scheme (EBSS), which saw every household receive a £400 discount on their energy bills, paid in six instalments from October 2022. ‌ Peter Levell, IFS’ deputy research director and author of the report, said: “The cost of supporting households through the energy price spike of late 2022 and early 2023 was extraordinary – £35bn over a six-month period. That is more than half the entire annual schools’ budget.\" ‌ READ MORE Foreign Office warns UK tourists to 'prepare' and says call 11-digit number The way that transfers were paid to households affected how they were spent. Households prepaying for their energy received the £400 energy bill rebates over Winter 2022–23 as vouchers (for traditional meters) or as automatic top-ups (for smart meters). Most households would have spent more than £400 on energy over this period in the absence of the rebates. This means the payment did not directly incentivise households to spend more on energy than if they had received the same amount as cash. Article continues below Mr Levell said: “Part of the reason for the huge cost was that the Government did not know which households had both low incomes and high energy use and so felt compelled to offer universal help. A big part of that help came in the form of a lower energy price, which itself led to higher demand, increasing the cost of the support. \"Investment now in better information could save billions in the future if we ever again face a similar surge in energy prices.”"

Renewable energy expansion faces hurdles: Economic Survey Survey cites energy storage technology, critical minerals as key challenges in transition to clean power sources By Avinash Nair Updated - January 31, 2025 at 07:51 PM. × Share WhatsApp X Facebook LinkedIn Messenger Reddit Mail https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/renewable-energy-expansion-faces-hurdles-economic-survey/article69164172.ece Copy Pointing out that renewable energy constitutes 47 per cent of India’s total installed capacity, the Economic Survey 2024-25 warns of substantial hurdles to further growth, particularly energy storage technologies and sourcing of critical minerals needed for the transition. The survey states that India has “negligible production capacity for key components like polysilicon, ingots, and wafers” and is dependent on imports, including from China, for its renewable energy requirements. “Despite being one of the world’s lowest greenhouse gas emitters per capita, India has made notable strides in reducing the emissions intensity of its energy consumption. This progress is largely due to the increased deployment of renewable energy sources alongside a suite of energy conservation measures. Nonetheless, the growth of renewable energy faces substantial hurdles, particularly in energy storage technologies and the sourcing of critical minerals necessary for this transition,” it states. “Lessons learned from the experiences of developed economies underscore the risks of prematurely shutting down thermal energy sources without viable technological alternatives that ensure a stable energy supply. The challenges mentioned in harnessing renewable energy at scale indicate that India will need to continue the efforts to maximise the efficiency of its existing fossil fuel resources in the medium term. The advancement and deployment of low-emission thermal power technologies, including Advanced Ultra Super Critical (AUSC) power plants, will play a pivotal role in this transition,” it added. The survey points out that India’s power sector has been bolstered primarily by large-scale solar and wind initiatives. By the end of December 2024, the country’s total renewable energy installed capacity increased by 15.8 per cent year-on-year, reaching 209.4 GW from 180.8 GW in December 2023. Renewable energy now constitutes about 47 per cent of India’s total installed capacity, highlighting a growing dependence on clean, non-fossil fuel-based energy sources. While alternative solutions such as green hydrogen present a viable option for the medium term, the economic survey states that “affordability issues” remain a significant barrier to widespread adoption. “Furthermore, although nuclear energy could contribute to India’s energy mix, its expansion is impeded by a lack of a supportive ecosystem and the monopolistic nature of nuclear fuel supply chains.” Comments More Like This Swiss technology for Avaada’s green ammonia plant in Odisha Suzlon Energy surges 5% on strong Q3 performance, manufacturing capacity boost KPI Green Energy signs ₹1,311 crore solar project deal with Coal India ACME Solar’s Q3 Results: Profit surges 152%, stock hits upper circuit two days in a row Published on January 31, 2025 READ MORE THIS AD SUPPORTS OUR JOURNALISM.

    "article_text": "skip to content Advertisement Premium Why the Union Budget needs to provide more for energy efficiency measures Energy efficiency initiatives have delivered massive savings for India over the last two decades. A lot more needs to be done – see how the math works out with a small subsidy for energy-efficient fans Written by Pramod Kumar Singh New Delhi | Updated: January 31, 2025 07:43 PM IST 5 min read Whatsapp twitter Facebook Reddit PRINT A government subsidy of Rs 1,000 per fan for 25 million energy-efficient models would cost Rs 2,500 crore and avoid 2.2 billion units (BU) of electricity generation per year. (Wikimedia Commons) India’s progress towards energy independence and sustainable development owes much to its progress in energy efficiency. Over the past two decades, these measures have safeguarded the country’s energy security, reducing reliance on imported energy sources and optimising resource usage. In more recent years, energy efficiency has become a keystone for climate security by helping India decarbonise and edge closer to its climate goals. Energy efficiency alone has contributed to almost one-third of the country’s energy intensity (energy consumption per unit of GDP) reduction between 2005 and 2020. The stakes are even higher post-pandemic. Resource constraints due to geopolitical tensions have underscored the importance of self-reliance. Energy efficiency is no longer just about conserving resources — it is central to national security and modernising India’s energy and urban infrastructure, reducing import dependence for energy and critical minerals, and positioning the nation as a competitive force on the global stage while contributing to climate goals . Story continues below this ad What kind of savings have resulted from India’s energy efficiency initiatives? Data from the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) underscore the tremendous impact energy efficiency initiatives have had until now. Consider the following: Over 2018-2023, cumulative energy savings from national schemes have amounted to 189 million tonnes of oil equivalent (MTOE), with electricity savings alone accounting for 90 million tonnes (1 MTOE is enough to power over 3 million Indian households for a year). In the financial year 2023, energy savings from national schemes resulted in 50.8 MTOE savings with an equal share of thermal and electrical savings. In the absence of energy efficiency, India’s energy consumption in 2022-23 would have been 6.6% higher than actuals, equivalent to the energy demand of Tamil Nadu . To put the 2022-23 energy savings in perspective, the avoided thermal energy is equivalent to coal usage in 20 power plants (7% of India’s yearly coal consumption), and avoided electricity is equivalent to generation from 80 coal-fired power plants. The electricity savings in 2022-23 is equivalent to installing 200 GW solar generation capacity whereas the country has added 97 GW solar till December 2024. The economic impact of these savings is equally significant, with a reported INR 1.84 lakh crore in cost reductions during 2022-23, comparable to about 1.1% of India’s GDP. Why do these efforts need even more attention? The budgetary allocations for energy efficiency programs remain disproportionately low compared to the allocation for renewable energy. For instance, in the 2023-24 Union Budget , Rs 19,100 crore was allocated to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, while the Bureau of Energy Efficiency received only Rs 230 crore. Story continues below this ad Such a difference overlooks the undeniable fact that energy efficiency measures often yield a far higher return on investment compared to renewable energy generation alone.

A government subsidy of Rs 1,000 per fan for 25 million energy-efficient models would cost Rs 2,500 crore. This investment would avoid 2.2 billion units (BU) of electricity generation per year, delivering double the energy savings compared to rooftop solar installations supported through equivalent subsidy size. In addition to energy savings, energy-efficient fans significantly reduce CO2 emissions, contributing to India’s climate mitigation efforts. As policymakers seek effective energy transition strategies, combining the distribution of energy-efficient appliances with renewable energy initiatives can drive compounded energy savings and emission reductions. What is the link between energy efficiency and climate security? We also need to recognise the indispensable role energy efficiency plays in modernising India’s energy and urban systems. Story continues below this ad While renewable energy investments are necessary to expand clean energy generation, they alone cannot achieve climate security or energy independence. The annual grid emissions factor has yet to see a meaningful decline, underscoring the urgent need for complementary energy efficiency measures. Moreover, investing in energy efficiency is not merely about reducing electricity consumption – it is about unlocking systemic savings across generation, transmission, and distribution. Losses in these areas represent significant economic and environmental costs, equivalent to the output of 55 coal power plants in 2021-22. Reducing these inefficiencies through targeted investments in energy efficiency would free up financial resources that can be redirected toward healthcare, education, and renewable energy projects.

Here are 5 charts on where India stands globally As India seeks to solidify its position as a global leader and become developed, energy efficiency must become a national priority. Story continues below this ad The Union Budget 2025 presents an opportunity for the government to recognise energy efficiency as the first fuel in its energy transition. This recognition must be accompanied by robust investment, policy support, and direct schemes designed to tap into the vast potential of energy efficiency measures. By doing so, India can achieve a clean, resilient, and competitive energy future. Prioritising energy efficiency will not only strengthen the nation’s energy security and climate resilience but also ensure that its economic ambitions are realised sustainably and inclusively.

    "article_text": "TIL Creatives Representational AI image. India’s green energy transition is being shaped by both domestic objectives and the evolving global trade landscape, as outlined in the Economic Survey 2024. The Survey stressed India’s commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2070, yet it noted the challenges in ensuring a smooth shift to renewable energy amid shifting global trade relations and policies. The report, prepared under the guidance of the Chief Economic Advisor to the Finance Ministry, cautions that trade conflicts between major economies—China, the United States, the European Union, and other G7 nations—could disrupt the supply and cost of crucial green technologies. Read Also | India needs 8% growth for two decades to achieve 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047, says Economic Survey 2024 Such disruptions could hinder global efforts to reduce emissions and could have significant repercussions for countries like India, which rely on imported clean energy technologies to meet their renewable energy targets. India's energy transition is closely tied to global trends, meaning that any tensions in international markets could not only delay but also escalate the cost of India’s green shift. These major economies, which collectively account for over 50% of global greenhouse gas emissions, have committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. They are also highly interdependent in the trade of critical environmental goods and technologies, such as solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicles. Live Events \"China, the United States, the EU, and other G7 economies produce more than 50 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. All have target dates of 2050 to reach net-zero emissions. These economies depend heavily on each other in the trade of environmental goods and technologies central to developing renewable energy and reducing emissions. Hence, trade conflicts between these economies will pose significant risks to the green energy transition, imposing huge costs on the global economy,\" read the report. China's role in global energy transition As the world's largest producer and consumer of renewable energy technologies, China plays a central role in the global green transition, said the report. For India, the pathway to energy transition runs through China, which dominates the production of solar panels, batteries, and other essential green technologies. India’s green energy goals are thus closely tied to China’s production capabilities and trade policies. \"As the world navigates the challenges of climate change, the road to energy transition runs through China,\" the report further read. Read Also | AI in Banking: Revolution or risk? Economic Survey 2024 warns of the fine line ahead While India has made significant strides in domestic renewable energy production, its reliance on imports from China for key components presents both opportunities and risks. The path ahead for India’s green transition Despite these challenges, India remains resolute in its commitment to combat climate change. The Panchamrit framework – which includes reducing the carbon intensity of its economy, increasing the share of non-fossil energy capacity, and achieving a net-zero target by 2070 – will guide the country’s green energy policies over the next few decades. The government’s focus on scaling renewable energy projects, promoting energy efficiency, and enhancing sustainability will remain pivotal as India navigates its energy transition. However, as the Economic Survey points out, the path to a green future is littered with global uncertainties. As trade conflicts and political challenges continue to affect global energy markets, India’s ability to meet its climate targets will depend not only on domestic policy and investment but also on how the global green energy landscape evolves.

Strategic investments, policy support, and green financial mechanisms could drive significant advancements towards India's renewable energy goals. Kavinder Khurana ET CONTRIBUTORS Updated On Jan 30, 2025 at 03:15 PM IST Copy Link Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on X Share on Telegram Share on Facebook But still, the high price for it and the nonexistence of a well-established supply chain in the country have inhibited its widespread use. The 2025 Union Budget of India marks an essential juncture in India's quest for a green future. Global energy dynamics are experiencing dramatic changes, offering India's renewable energy sector an incredible opportunity to help combat climate change while simultaneously increasing energy independence. But its success hinges on strategic investments, policy support and creating an ecosystem to facilitate clean energy technologies. The 2025 Budget presents India with an unparalleled opportunity to give renewable energy an extra push. At its core will be providing critical infrastructure like energy storage systems that unlock intermittent renewable sources like solar and wind power. By incentivizing domestic battery manufacturing , supporting innovative storage solutions, and expanding financial mechanisms, India could unleash a sustainable yet economically robust green revolution. Advt India's renewable energy capacity is on a mounting trajectory. One of its remaining challenges to fulfillment, though, is the move from intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar to completely storage-based energy, which requires robust technology, while one of its ambitious projections of hitting 500 gigawatts from BESS-sourced wind and solar energy by the year 2030 will need it as a source. A BESS System, or energy storage battery, saves energy generated when the power requirement for the generation of energy is high and releases it when generation is lower and demand is higher. This great compression technology even works with substances like wind and solar to make up for their non-constant nature, which is a major setback. But still, the high price for it and the nonexistence of a well-established supply chain in the country have inhibited its widespread use. Budget 2025 : An opportunity for energy storage and battery manufacturing The 2025 Budget presents an unprecedented opportunity to tackle these challenges head-on by creating policies that encourage energy storage solutions to grow and drive innovation in this sector. India needs an ecosystem for green finance that will fuel the development of Battery Energy storage system by providing reduced financing costs and clear long-term incentives, which in turn could fuel its transition towards renewables. Government incentives could take the form of subsidies or tax breaks for investments in Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), which are currently costly to deploy. Such incentives could significantly lower upfront costs for businesses, utilities, and consumers when adopting BESS across the country. An increase in demand would also encourage private investments, further driving innovation and competition within the storage market. Advt India has a unique opportunity to position itself as a manufacturing hub for lead-acid batteries, which remain a cornerstone of energy storage systems in various applications. While the focus has often been on advanced technologies, lead-acid batteries offer a cost-effective and reliable solution for energy storage. By offering fiscal incentives such as tax rebates or concessional financing to domestic lead-acid battery manufacturers, the 2025 Budget can bolster local production, reduce dependency on imports, create jobs, and expand India’s technological capabilities in this field. Battery as a Service (BaaS): An emerging energy storage model One novel concept that could transform India's energy storage landscape is Battery as a Service (BaaS). Under this model, consumers rent batteries instead of owning them outright for renewable energy storage applications or other uses. This eliminates upfront costs while shifting maintenance, replacement, and upgrade burdens to service providers. For BaaS to gain momentum, governments must incentivize its adoption through targeted subsidies and tax breaks. Furthermore, policy frameworks must support the establishment of a robust BaaS infrastructure throughout the nation, including storage hubs and battery-swapping facilities. BaaS could serve as a game-changer for millions of consumers across both urban and rural settings, encouraging greater adoption of decentralized energy storage solutions. By eliminating financial barriers to the ownership of batteries, it aligns with India’s renewable energy ambitions while also creating new business opportunities for service providers. Addressing prohibitive GST on batteries and BESS One critical issue hindering the large-scale adoption of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) in India is the 28per cent GST levied on batteries and BESS. This highest slab of GST significantly increases the cost of these essential products, making them prohibitive for widespread adoption. The government should consider reducing this GST rate in the 2025 Budget to make batteries and BESS more affordable. A lower GST rate could encourage large-scale adoption, drive innovation, and help align India’s clean energy goals with economic viability. Green finance and global partnerships: A path forward The Indian government has already made great strides toward encouraging green investments through initiatives like issuing green bonds aimed at financing projects with environmental benefits. However, further work needs to be done on green finance in energy storage and battery manufacturing environments, particularly with regard to battery manufacturing capacity expansion. The 2025 Budget may offer an important opportunity to boost green bonds, green banks, and other innovative financial instruments that would channel private capital towards renewable energy infrastructure development. India can benefit substantially from collaborating with global players in the renewable energy and battery manufacturing sectors. As demand for clean energy solutions rises globally, India offers enormous potential for international partnerships in these fields. India should create an environment conducive to such collaborations in its 2025 Budget by streamlining regulatory processes, offering stable policy support, and offering incentives for joint ventures in battery manufacturing or renewable energy storage projects. India should adopt elements to facilitate its transition towards cleaner and more sustainable energy production and consumption; additionally, these components would position India as a global leader in renewable energy innovation and production. Innovation-powered green future India's 2025 Union Budget holds great promise to be a game-changer for its renewable energy sector. By addressing critical storage issues, incentivizing domestic battery manufacturing, and supporting innovative business models like BaaS, this Budget could accelerate India's transition towards a greener and more sustainable future. In conclusion, now is the time for industrialists, policymakers, and global leaders to shape this transformation with strategic investments, policy incentives, and technological breakthroughs that combine to meet India's ambitious renewable energy targets while becoming global powerhouses within this sector.

    "article_text": "Published on Africa Can End Poverty Unleashing opportunities for women in Africa with access to energy Nathalie Kouassi Akon January 28, 2025 This page in: English English English Woman in village thrilled to get a Sun King Pro solar lantern that provides affordable energy access through PAYG (pay-as-you-go) and charges mobile phones. Photo: Sun King The extraordinary lack of energy in Africa–affecting about 300 million women-has profound effects on women’s economic opportunities. Women are already disproportionately affected by energy poverty, especially in rural areas. On average, women and girls spend 50 hours a week just fetching firewood, cooking, and collecting water. That’s 50 hours spent on subsistence, not on growing a business, pursuing education, or improving their health. In fact, 900 million African women and girls who lack access to clean cooking technology suffer from smoke inhalation-related diseases. That’s a huge barrier to their health, education, and economic potential. Now, imagine a world where women have access to reliable electricity, clean cooking, and safe water. Not only would their quality of life improve, but their economic opportunities would expand. Women in rural areas are more likely to become wage-earners when they have access to electricity. They can run businesses, engage in entrepreneurial ventures, and contribute to their economies in ways that were previously impossible. More women would own or lead small and medium sized enterprises (SME), creating jobs and stimulating growth in their countries. We can't ignore the fact that energy access is also directly tied to gender-based violence (GBV). About 44% of African women have experienced GBV, and the lack of energy only exacerbates this issue. Power outages, for example, contribute to the insecurity and vulnerability that many women face. The lack of energy also impedes women’s access to financial services, limiting their ability to support and empower themselves, and grow their businesses. Simply put, energy access is an essential tool in the fight for women’s rights and economic empowerment . This is where the of the World Bank Group (WBG)’s three institutions IBRD, IFC, and MIGA, come in. Mission 300 aims to connect 300 million Africans to electricity by 2030 through both grid connections and renewable energy solutions. We will make huge strides with projects such as the Nigeria Distributed Access through Renewable Energy Scale-up (DARES), Accelerating Sustainable and Clean Energy Access Transformation (ASCENT) , Acumen’s Hardest to Reach Initiative, and Release by Scatec , which will bring power to 250 million people. The African Development Bank is also joining the effort, helping another 50 million people gain access to energy. It’s clear that energy access is a game changer for women. When women have reliable access to energy, their ability to educate their children, run businesses, and improve their own health and safety skyrockets. It creates a ripple effect that benefits entire communities. Clean energy access is tied to everything from improved health and education to better wages and less GBV. But the key is ensuring that energy solutions are affordable, accessible, and meet the specific needs of women. This is where governments, organizations, and businesses need to step up. We need to prioritize women’s needs in the energy sector from clean cooking, to water access, to safety. It’s time to unlock the full economic potential of women by giving them the tools they need to succeed. If we want to unleash Africa's full potential, we can’t afford to leave women behind. So, let’s move from the dream to reality and keep pushing to connect more people with affordable, sustainable energy and clean cooking. As energy access expands, the future is bright, especially for women.

    "article_text": "EDP Renewables North America Yahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article. This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) published a white paper outlining the industry group's vision for U.S. energy storage, setting a target to install 10 million distributed energy storage sites and reach 700 kWh of installed storage capacity the end of the decade. The white paper, released Jan. 28 along with a guide to energy storage regulatory policies in each of the 50 states, discusses policy recommendations that would open markets for development of energy storage. The paper, which can be accessed here , also looks at ways to obtain financial support for storage, build a U.S. storage supply chain, and support the continuing push for long-duration storage technology. “Expanding energy storage capacity is a crucial means of ensuring our nation’s energy security and resilience,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “As demand for energy soars, storage helps turn quick-to-build, low-cost solar generation into clean, dispatchable power, ensuring our grid can adapt to challenges, support critical infrastructure, and deliver reliable power to every community.” Connect with POWER at the InterSolar & Energy Storage North America conference in San Diego, California, Feb. 25-27, 2025. Read more of POWER's coverage of energy storage here , and make plans now to attend Experience POWER , our long-running flagship event, scheduled for Oct. 29-31, 2025, in Denver, Colorado. Data from Wood Mackenzie shows there currently is 83 GWh of installed energy storage capacity in the U.S. The group also said there are nearly 500,000 distributed storage installations. SEIA on its website states, “Solar and storage are a dynamic pair, and together will form the backbone of a clean, reliable electricity system. Storage is critical to our nation’s climate stability, energy resilience and abundance, and to a smoothly operating grid.” Jason Kaminsky, CEO of kWh Analytics , a renewable energy risk assessment group, told POWER that solar paired with energy storage will be the primary source of long-term growth to meet increasing energy demand. “Despite an expected near-term increase in natural gas, solar and storage will continue to be the primary source of long-term growth to meet increasing energy demand spurred on by economic growth, crypto and AI,” said Kaminsky. The executive also said that resilient supply chains will enable solar to manage industry cost structure, even in the face of new or stronger tariffs from the Trump administration. “Solar and storage growth are unlikely to be excessively disadvantaged by new or strengthened tariffs. Years of prior tariffs and restrictions have made solar supply chains resilient and dynamic, historically enabling the industry to manage cost structure,” said Kaminsky. 'Positive' About Solar and Storage Eric Packer, senior vice president of Strategic Initiatives at Rexel USA , a major U.S. electrical distribution company, recently told POWER his company remains positive about solar energy paired with energy storage. “Our outlook remains positive for PV and energy storage systems. Stored solar energy enables the allocation of energy on demand instead of only being able to have energy when the sun is up, which has been a limiting factor,” said Packer. “We continue to see interest and investments in microgrids, which harness solar energy and reapply it back to the grid at peak demand times or as needed from demand.” Current industry forecasts show that U.S. storage capacity is expected to reach 450 GWh by 2030, though analysts have said that is not enough to support the need for storage, which often is used to help balance the intermittency of renewable energy resources such as solar and wind power. The SEIA is asking states, regional transmission organizations, and the federal government to pursue accelerated deployment of energy storage, and more manufacturing of equipment to serve the sectors. The actions include: Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Preserving the federal tax credit for standalone storage. Ensuring equal grid access and fair compensation to storage for grid services. Reforming interconnection processes to account for storage flexibility. Establishing affordable retail rates for storage charging. Supporting domestic manufacturing with targeted trade policies and streamlined permitting. Implementing state-level procurement programs. Emphasizing investments in low-income communities, including areas disproportionately impacted by extreme weather and poor air quality. Investing in further development of long-duration storage. “The U.S. storage market is at an inflection point, but with the mix of policy support and private, state and federal collaboration, we can achieve SEIA’s storage targets while creating jobs and ensuring reliable, around the clock power for every home and business in this county,” said Joan White, SEIA’s director of storage and interconnection. Andrew Tang, vice president, Energy Storage and Optimization for Wärtsilä Energy , recently addressed the landscape for energy storage. Tang told POWER : “In an effort to reach these goals, [e.g. ambitious climate targets from COP29 and the rapid expansion of AI infrastructure], energy storage projects will continue to grow in size and scope. The size of energy storage projects has been steadily increasing to the multi-gigawatt-hour scale and will continue to do so next year.” Tang continued, “Energy storage systems will continue to be increasingly geared towards energy shifting, driven by the ever-growing penetration of intermittent renewable energy generation and the concomitant need to store energy for dispatch in times when supply and demand are mismatched. At the same time, dedicated renewables firming requirements are popping up in a diversity of markets globally. As these projects move closer to population centers, addressing challenges like noise mitigation and fire safety will become even more critical. “The growth of energy storage will continue alongside the drive for renewable energy expansion. We’ll see the supply chain evolve in 2025, with the industry moving toward further diversifying manufacturing resources to ensure that supply meets both customer cost and market requirements,” said Tang. — Darrell Proctor is a senior editor for POWER.

    "article_text": "What The Side Of The Bed You Sleep On Says About Your Energy Did you know there's a side of the bed for masculine and feminine energy? Mary-Faith Martinez Written on Jan 29, 2025 Nenad Aksic | Shutterstock Advertisement Whether you share a bed with a significant other or not, everyone has a preferred side when it comes to a good night's rest. Think about walking into a hotel room — there's always a bedside you are immediately drawn to. Why is that? Have you ever wondered if the side of the bed you sleep on holds any significance to you as a person? Well, according to feng shui practitioners, it certainly does. Believe it or not, it actually determines whether you have more masculine or feminine energy. Advertisement The side of the bed you sleep on affects the kind of energy you have. A woman named Elle shared some things she had recently learned about feng shui that helped her understand what sleeping on each side of the bed means for your energy. “It was talking about [how] one side of your body is the feminine and one side of your body is the masculine, right?” she said of the video she watched. “And how specifically the side that you sleep on impacts the energy that you are embodying, and the energy that you are leaving space to receive, right, um, or to enter your life in some way.” AtnoYdur | Canva Pro Advertisement “Which I feel like makes sense, right?” she continued. “You’re sitting in that energy while you’re sleeping for anywhere, like, from roughly eight hours a day.” Elle said that, if you wanted, you could also use this information to change or retrain your energy.“If that’s something that you’re trying to, like, train yourself to be in, it’s very fascinating,” she said. Elle also said this has proven true in her own life. “I was, like, reflecting … back to my relationships, and I’m like, ‘Oh my goodness,’” she shared. “I’m not kidding. My side of the bed switched in almost every single one of my relationships when I, like, started becoming more masculine in the relationship, and I started sleeping on the masculine side of the bed.” She added, “And currently, I sleep on the masculine side of the bed as a single mom who very regularly needs to embody my masculine energy .” RELATED: 3 Habits Happy People With Deep, Meaningful Relationships Have Mastered, According to a Mindset Coach Advertisement Which sides of the bed hold masculine and feminine energy? After discussing the basics of this energy phenomenon, Elle addressed the real question in everyone’s minds i n a follow-up video . “If you are walking into a room, you’re looking at your bed, so you’re at the foot of your bed,” she described. “If you sleep on the left side of the bed, then you’re embodying your feminine energy, where if you sleep on the right side of the bed, you’re embodying your masculine energy.” Elle explained that this comes from the idea that there are masculine and feminine energy sides of the body. “And that goes for your physical body as well, right?” she continued. “Um, your physical body, everything on the left side of your body is your feminine energy, and everything on your right side of the body is your masculine energy.” As an example, Elle used pain in the left hip, which she said could be indicative of a mother wound. “It’s almost like, I think that when you’re ready to deal with something, your body and your mind unlock it for you, right? Uh, they start giving you breadcrumbs so that you consciously can deal with something your subconscious has been holding onto,” she concluded. Advertisement RELATED: 10 Ways To Activate & Tap Into Your Dark Feminine Energy The concept of masculine and feminine energies, each taking up one side of the body, is connected to the idea of yin and yang. According to Australia’s Kevala Health , “The Yin energy is feminine, and the Yang is masculine. We are made up of both feminine and masculine energy. These two very different energies complement each other.” More for You: Taylor Swift's Former Classmate Explains Why 'People Hated Her' In High School How To Spot A REAL Narcissist (And Not Just A Bad Person) Boss Uses ‘Wobbly Chair Test’ In Every Interview And Avoids Hiring Job Candidates That Fail People Born On These 6 Days Of Any Month Are Destined For Financial Success Kevala Health confirmed that the left side of your body correlates to feminine energy and the right side to masculine energy. As Elle said, this is also true of the sides of the bed. Advertisement Vlada Karpovich | Pexels By understanding the energy behind the side of the bed you sleep on, you can better understand yourself and your own behavior. You can also work to make changes as you see fit. Ultimately, what's most important is that you choose the side of the bed that helps you get the best night's sleep.

He highlighted the ongoing restructuring of the Arab Energy Organization to better align with future needs, ensuring its role in sustainable development and meeting member states’ demands. The minister noted that upcoming projects by the Arab Energy Fund will diversify energy sources while aligning with global efforts to reduce emissions and combat climate change. The Arab world is committed to adapting to the evolving energy landscape while maintaining regional identity and cooperation, he added. Arab unity and collective action are essential for addressing regional and international challenges, whether economic, social or cultural, he remarked. CEO of the Arab Energy Fund, Khalid Al-Ruwaigh pointed to the institution’s progress since its founding in 1975 with a capital of $320 million. He revealed that over five decades, its assets have grown to exceed $10 billion, reflecting its role in supporting the energy sector and sustainability efforts. Al-Ruwaigh said the fund’s success is measured not just by its financial growth but also by its impact on energy development. He announced a new strategic vision focused on innovative financial solutions, including debt instruments and investments in both conventional and renewable energy, to support member states’ sustainability goals. Relocating the fund’s headquarters to Riyadh reinforces its position as a trusted financial institution in a major global financial hub, he noted Moreover, Al-Ruwaigh unveiled the fund’s new identity and logo, symbolizing Arab cooperation for sustainable energy development. The logo’s triangular elements represent the ten member states, while its circular design reflects the fund’s commitment to a circular economy and long-term energy sustainability."

    "article_text": "... By Jesus Mesa Politics Reporter Share Newsweek is a Trust Project member President Donald Trump 's latest energy-related executive orders, widely criticized by environmentalists, may unexpectedly support efforts to combat climate change, an issue he has previously denied. Issued during the first week of his second term, the orders aim to deregulate fossil fuel production, streamline permitting and roll back key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), spurring intense debate. But the measures may inadvertently boost climate action by addressing inefficiencies in renewable energy deployment and encouraging advanced nuclear power, according to an expert. Why It Matters The executive order, titled \"Unleashing American Energy,\" directs federal agencies to \"suspend, revise, or rescind all agency actions identified as unduly burdensome\" to domestic energy production. During the campaign, Trump advocated for an energy policy focused on fossil fuels, emphasizing infrastructure like roads, bridges and combustion-engine vehicles. \"Drill, baby, drill!\" was a frequent rallying cry. ... These actions, along with the rollback of subsidies for wind and solar power, underscore Trump's skepticism of environmental policies and his disdain for renewable energy, criticizing Biden-era investments aimed at reducing U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. What To Know While often portrayed as a boost to the fossil fuel industry, some argue that recent measures under Trump's administration could also streamline the development of clean energy technologies, particularly nuclear power. \"This seems like a simple story of a callous administration gleefully wrecking the environment to benefit its fossil fuel backers,\" Quico Toro, contributing editor for Persuasion , wrote in a recent analysis. \"But it's not so simple. By killing their worst ideas, [Trump's administration] has just done the climate movement a big favor.\" Toro argues that overreliance on weather-dependent renewable energy sources like wind and solar has led to grid instability and rising energy prices. Removing regulatory barriers to nuclear development, he adds, could pave the way for more sustainable and politically viable decarbonization strategies. A Mixed Reception Among Environmentalists Environmental advocates have sharply criticized Trump's actions, viewing them as a rollback of the climate-friendly policies implemented under former President Joe Biden . The rollback of IRA and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funding disbursements, combined with the exclusion of wind and solar from the administration's definition of \"domestic energy,\" signals a deliberate de-emphasis on renewables. Additionally, according to a Harvard Environmental Law Program analysis of the executive order, the administration's declaration of a national energy emergency has been challenged as unnecessary, given the record-high levels of oil and natural gas production in recent years. \"In 2023, the U.S. produced an average of 12.9 million barrels of crude oil per day, the highest in history, and exported 11.9 billion cubic feet of LNG [liquefied natural gas] daily,\" it says. But analysts like Toro see potential benefits in Trump's push for deregulation, particularly for nuclear energy. New orders aimed at streamlining permitting processes under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) could benefit large-scale infrastructure projects, including advanced nuclear plants. ... \"NEPA has become a NIMBY's best friend, creating a labyrinthine permitting process that lets anti-development groups delay projects they don't like,\" Toro wrote. By cutting red tape, the administration could accelerate the deployment of next-generation nuclear reactors, which provide reliable, zero-emission energy. Chris Wright, Trump's energy secretary, expressed optimism about nuclear power's role in America's energy future. \"We're committed to bringing advanced nuclear technology to market,\" Wright said during a press briefing. \"This administration understands that energy abundance and environmental responsibility can coexist.\" Addressing Renewable Energy's Limitations A central focus of Trump's energy agenda is addressing the shortcomings of renewable energy, particularly its intermittency. Wind and solar power rely on weather conditions, leading to grid instability and higher costs when paired with insufficient energy storage solutions. \"If this administration seriously pursues licensing fourth-generation nuclear plant designs, Trump could—paradoxically—be remembered for ending the fossil fuel economy,\" Toro wrote in Persuasion . Despite these potential upsides, critics remain skeptical. \"It's clear this administration prioritizes fossil fuel development above all else,\" said environmental policy expert Emily Rodriguez in an interview with PBS . \"While nuclear power is part of the equation, the broader push to expand oil and gas production undermines renewable energy efforts.\" What People Are Saying Jason Ryan, spokesperson for the American Clean Power Association, told the Associated Press : \"Energy dominance requires a true 'all of the above' energy approach that unleashes our nation's diverse resources to meet surging demand.\" Trump, in his inauguration address: \"We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top, and export American energy all over the world.\" Wright, Trump's energy secretary and also founder of Liberty Energy: \"Our aim is to boost natural gas and nuclear energy, moving away from the previous administration's clean energy priorities.\" What Happens Next The long-term impact of Trump's energy policies will depend on implementation and market dynamics. Experts like Toro argue that shifting focus to nuclear power could help the U.S. achieve its climate goals more effectively than a singular reliance on wind and solar.

    "article_text": "Business Automotive Economy Energy Finance Tourism Tech Defense Transportation News Analysis Türkiye's solar capacity doubles in 2.5 years to surpass 2025 target by Daily Sabah ISTANBUL Jan 28, 2025 - 2:35 pm GMT+3 A solar power plant is seen in Bayburt province, northeastern Türkiye, Jan. 8, 2025. (AA Photo) by Daily Sabah Jan 28, 2025 2:35 pm Türkiye has doubled its solar energy capacity over the past two-and-a-half years to surpass its 2025 target ahead of schedule, signaling the nation’s potential for more ambitious future goals, a report said Tuesday. By the end of 2024, Türkiye’s solar energy capacity exceeded 19 gigawatts (GW), doubling from 9.7 GW in July 2022, London-based energy think tank Ember said. By August last year, the country had already surpassed the 18 GW target set for 2025 in the National Energy Plan (NEP) by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources. “Achieving this target one and a half years ahead of schedule underscores Türkiye’s strong commitment to solar energy and signals the need for more ambitious future targets,” Ember said. The previous doubling of solar energy capacity required more than four years between 2018 and 2022, it noted. The rapid expansion was driven primarily by self-consumption solar installations, which accounted for 94% of new projects since July 2022. To advance the momentum, Ember said Türkiye could utilize rooftop, hybrid, floating and storage-integrated solar potential, which it says collectively represent a vast untapped potential. Ember says Türkiye has a pipeline of 33 GW in pre-licensed storage-integrated solar and wind projects, far exceeding the official 2030 target of 2.1 GW. “With these capacities, the country is well-positioned to sustain its renewable energy growth trajectory,” the think tank says. New opportunities The Renewable Energy Resource Zone (YEKA) model remains pivotal to Türkiye’s solar and wind expansion. The scheme was introduced in 2016 to facilitate land allocation for investors, ease the deployment of large projects and encourage the domestic production of renewable energy technologies. Under the YEKA scope, 3 GW of solar energy tenders have been conducted over eight years, resulting in 1.5 GW of capacity being commissioned, while 630 MW of projects were canceled. The government unveiled updates to the YEKA model in 2024 to draw greater investor interest. Key enhancements include simplifying post-tender permitting procedures and introducing financial incentives like exemptions from transmission fees. Furthermore, the planned 800 MW solar power plant tender for 2025 has increased the total capacity of the YEKA solar power plants project portfolio to 3.8 GW. According to the Energy and Natural Resources Ministry’s Renewable Energy 2035 Road Map, Türkiye aims to conduct at least 2 GW of wind and solar tenders annually. The Ember report also highlighted the potential for 53 GW of floating solar power plants, which could utilize underused water surfaces and significantly increase renewable capacity through YEKA auctions. “With hybrid plants, YEKA projects and the 24 GW of self-consumption-focused solar power plants currently under development, solar energy capacity could increase two and a half times by the end of this decade, surpassing 55 GW,” it noted. Battery storage also represents a growing opportunity, according to Ember. By the end of 2024, Türkiye had granted pre-licenses for 14 GW of solar projects with integrated storage, pointing to the potential for enhanced energy security and grid stability. That figure far exceeds the 2.1 GW storage capacity target set in the NEP for 2030. Renewables save $15 billion Over the past two-and-a-half years, solar and wind energy have saved Türkiye $15 billion, which would have otherwise been paid for natural gas imports, Ember said. “This underscores that raising renewable capacity targets not only strengthens Türkiye’s energy independence but also amplifies its economic benefits,” it added. Solar energy alone accounted for 6% of the country’s electricity supply, generating 52 terawatt-hours (TWh) over the past two and a half years. “This avoided $5.4 billion in natural gas imports over the same period,” the report said. Türkiye unveiled its National Energy Plan in 2023, establishing renewable energy and sustainability targets for 2025, 2030, and 2035. However, during COP29 in November 2024, the Environment, Urbanization, and Climate Change Ministry presented the Long-Term Climate Change Strategy (LTS) that included updates to 2030 and 2035 benchmarks. The solar capacity target for 2035 was revised under the LTS to 77 GW, an ambitious 45% increase from the NEP’s initial goal of 53 GW. Bahadır Sercan Gümüş, energy analyst at Ember, emphasized that the consistent growth in solar capacity demonstrates Türkiye’s potential for more ambitious renewable energy targets. “By doubling its solar energy capacity in just two and a half years and surpassing its 2025 target ahead of schedule, Türkiye has demonstrated its potential to set more ambitious goals, Gümüş said. “Raising renewable energy targets and maintaining the momentum offers Türkiye the opportunity to reduce its dependence on energy imports, strengthen energy security, and assert its commitment more prominently on the international stage.” shortlink copied KEYWORDS renewable energy energy power solar energy solar power plant türkiye The Daily Sabah Newsletter Keep up to date with what’s happening in Turkey, it’s region and the world.

Generate Key Takeaways The Capitol in Salt Lake City is pictured on Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch) Can Utah become the energy capital of the country? The Legislature is willing to explore that, aiming to become pioneers in nuclear energy developments, creating a set of governing bodies that are expected to oversee energy development zones and, overall, setting a foundation for the future of nuclear power in Utah. HB249 , or Nuclear Power Amendments, a big bill sponsored by Rep. Carl Albretch, R-Richfield, creates the Nuclear Energy Consortium and the Utah Energy Council, which would lead the way to designate energy development zones throughout the state. The House Public Utilities and Energy Committee voted unanimously to recommend the bill for the full House’s consideration. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement It may take awhile before nuclear energy is powering electricity-hungry data centers across the state. But, Albrecht said on Monday, this is a starter for the nuclear industry in the state — and other resources in Utah’s energy mix. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX “Anybody that knows anything about energy will tell you that unless the new administration on the federal level loosens up regulation for nuclear, we’re still 10, 12-plus years down the road to have a fully operating nuclear plant in the state of Utah,” he said. “However, there are SMRs that have been developed, small modular reactors. They can be put on the back of a truck as big as this room and placed somewhere.” In line with Republican leadership’s main goals for this legislative session to allow the construction of small nuclear reactors in Utah, the council would oversee site identification — including state lands — permitting, financial plans for the projects, and other strategies for energy development. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement During the committee hearing Albrecht praised nuclear power as being clean and plentiful. And while most data centers have expressed a desire to have “green-washed” power, as he described it, meaning mostly wind and solar, those resources are intermittent. “I think we need to be on the cutting edge in the state of Utah, as we are on a lot of things, and start down this nuclear path,” he said. But, some Utahns, looking at a long history of nuclear disasters, remained skeptical of the state’s plans. A new Utah Energy Council The bill has 25 pages, which Albrecht said is oddly long for him. However, there are many moving parts in it. The Utah Energy Council, for example, will have appointees from legislative leadership, the governor’s office and the Office of Energy Development. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement With this bill, the state is also expected to work alongside counties, cities and towns in the process of establishing “energy development zones.” These areas will only go to the municipalities that want and approve them, Albrecht said, and will be evaluated according to their suitability in hosting energy infrastructure projects, which includes factors such as access to energy resources and proximity to existing transmission lines. Nuclear development and electricity rates to dominate energy discussion this legislative session The legislation calls for public incentives restrictions to avoid “pitting one county against the other in a bidding process.” Tax increment from the energy zones will be allocated to the Energy Development Investment Fund for the council to administer for energy infrastructure development. But, the council is required to consult with municipalities to determine a tax sharing plan. The fund can also be used to match funds from federal grants, Albrecht said, which lawmakers are already counting on. “If the Trump administration decides we’re going to move forward on energy and ‘drill, baby, drill,’ then there probably will be some federal energy grants,” he said. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement If the bill passes, there would also be an energy research boost, since Utah would also form a research board with representatives from The University of Utah, Utah State University, the Commissioner of Higher Education, and the Idaho National Laboratory, among others. In a state full of downwinders, safety concerns linger The committee’s public comment period saw a mix of approval and concern over the unintended consequences of hosting a nuclear reactor. The bill has the support of the executive branch, some officials said on Monday. It’s building momentum and advancing on past state efforts, such as the San Rafael Energy Lab, Joel Ferry, executive director of the Utah Department of Natural Resources, told the committee. But, the bill was also presented during the National Day of Remembrance for American Downwinders, which commemorates those who died from cancer or other diseases caused by nuclear radiation exposure from U.S. weapons testing, a big reminder of what could go wrong if the resources are mishandled. Sen. Hawley blasts rumors of expanding payments for Utah downwinders only “The government representatives had so much enthusiasm for the very legitimate positive benefits of nuclear that they failed to grasp and account for the very severe dangers associated with it,” Mike Maxwell, who identified himself as a former employee of a nuclear power producer, said. “Nuclear energy is powerful; it can also be incredibly dangerous to all the living things on this planet.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Maxwell asked lawmakers to keep working on the bill, since it lacks an oversight process for health and environmental issues in the application of energy zones. Ava Curtis, who’s pursuing a career in environmental studies, said that while she understands the need to opt for low-carbon energy sources, her family’s health history is a constant reminder of why she believes nuclear isn’t the way to go. “My mom worked at the uranium labs. She used to look out the window of her office to see the river below her office glowing, something her boss told her happens all the time and with no cause for concern,” she said. “Cancer and genetic disorders are incredibly high in the community, including in my own family.” She urged that those who have been the most impacted by nuclear energy have a voice in the energy council, including indigenous communities that have been at the center of the uranium industry. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Albrecht, however, defended his bill, arguing that nuclear electricity generation is different from what caused those health problems throughout history. “Our cemeteries are full of people who were affected by the downwind, but that was the government lying to us, as somebody said, and that was caused by above-ground test blasts,” he said. “It was not caused by the generation of electric power.” The technology keeps improving, Albrecht said, getting to a point where it’s safer and waste could be processed again. The bill is still a work in progress and “probably does need some work on health and safety,” but it’s a start, he said. Now, how much will it cost? Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “There’ll be some great shock,” Albrecht said about the price. “ But this will not be a plant tomorrow or the next day or the next year. This plant generation is going to be 10, 15 years down the road, and hopefully technology improves and we regenerate power with zero carbon.” SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE About Our Ads"

    "article_text": "Three reasons to focus on energy-transition infrastructure Allocations to this area are highly differentiated. Growth in energy demand makes this a sunrise market. And environmental and sustainability benefits are on tap Summarise Share Energy-transition assets are part of the growing infrastructure market, where new capital is likely to be constantly required over the next 20 to 30 years. PHOTO: PIXABAY Minal Patel Published Tue, Jan 28, 2025 · 04:50 PM FOR more than 200 years, the global economy was dependent on fossil fuels for its energy needs. This is rapidly changing. Renewable energy, driven by the so-called “power trio” of decarbonisation, affordability and energy security, is becoming a critical factor in meeting future power needs. The global energy transition thus represents a potentially unparalleled and attractive investment opportunity. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that around US$4.5 trillion needs to be invested each year into the energy transition from the early 2030s, an almost three-fold increase from 2023, itself a record year. This investment is on a global basis, with almost universal support for evolving a decarbonised, cheap and secure energy system. Even in the US and despite a shifting political climate, there has been broad, widespread and largely bipartisan support for renewables investment over a number of years, given that the sector is a key engine for job creation and that it increasingly delivers energy cost-competitiveness. Despite this, a question we often get asked is: Why invest solely in the energy transition? The assumption inherent to the question is that an investment into a wider infrastructure mandate – including exposure to energy-transition assets, as well as other sectors such as utilities, transport and digital infrastructure – could offer a broader opportunity set. Given that investors’ capacity to allocate to alternative assets is finite (on average representing around 14 per cent of portfolios according to Schroders research), and is therefore a scarce resource, the value of which must be utilised to its full potential, we believe maximising investment in energy transition is crucial for a high-performing portfolio, for three key reasons. Highly differentiated The first reason is that energy-transition allocations are highly differentiated, relative to other investments you hold in your portfolio. A historical analysis of annualised returns and risk (volatility) between 2014 and 2024 shows that the overall, long-term risk-and-return characteristics of energy-transition infrastructure largely align with those of broader infrastructure portfolios. This in itself is an interesting observation, contradicting the widely held belief that diversified infrastructure portfolios must be less risky due to their diversified nature. The analysis is also limited by assessing aggregate risk and return independently. It doesn’t capture the dynamics of specific, underlying risk exposures within energy transition infrastructure and how these can translate to long-term return potential. Intuitively, the risks associated with energy-transition infrastructure are highly diversifying, exposing investors to a unique mix of risk premia, compared to non-energy infrastructure sub-sectors and other asset classes. Here are some sources of risk: SEE ALSO Sustainable corporate bonds: rising demand amid tight supply The inauguration of a new chapter in sustainable investing Inflation risk: Returns are typically linked to inflation, helping to maintain the real purchasing power of a portfolio. Positive power price risk: Energy transition assets benefit from increases in electricity prices, unlike other asset classes and non-energy infrastructure, where electricity is a major cost input. Resource/weather risk: Few other parts of a portfolio are as meaningfully impacted, positively or negatively, by meteorological factors as renewables assets. Technology risk: Each renewable technology and asset, whether it is a solar park or a wind farm, carries specific risks – and diversification opportunities. Geography/policy risk: Policy and regulation supporting the energy transition are rapidly developing in most regions around the world, providing a favourable investment climate. These differentiated risk premia associated with energy-transition assets result in robust diversification benefits. Correlation data supports this, with energy-transition infrastructure demonstrating low year-on-year return correlation to all asset classes – including diversified infrastructure – and even negative correlations to more economically cyclical equity and fixed income assets. So, while the overall, long-term risk and return of energy-transition infrastructure has historically been broadly similar to traditional infrastructure, the underlying “pattern” and drivers of returns are very different. This in turn suggests that including an energy-transition allocation, even in place of diversified infrastructure, has the potential to bring positive diversification benefits to portfolios. Energy investment as a primary focus The second reason is that energy transition assets are part of the infrastructure market that is growing. New capital is expected to be constantly required over the next 20 to 30 years to build out a new, sustainable global energy system, and respond to significant ongoing growth in energy demand. In terms of deal activity in global infrastructure, energy is by far the largest sector by deal volume. Within this, renewable energy is by a wide margin the largest energy sub-sector – and is, in fact, the largest single sector within infrastructure as a whole, accounting for 48 per cent of all investment over the past 15 years. The growth in renewable investment opportunities is of crucial importance, as it speaks not only to the opportunity set, but also to pricing. As a growing market, the energy sector needs to consistently incentivise and attract capital. New opportunities are consistently being developed, requiring capital at all stages of an investment’s life cycle, from earlier stages of development to investment in assets that developers, utilities or investors have already taken through construction and into operations, allowing them to recycle capital into new projects. With many developers’ capital constrained, the requirement to recycle capital through the sale of operational assets is particularly pronounced in today’s market, contributing to a scenario where there are motivated sellers, which in turn can help to underpin strong returns. The accompanying chart shows the levered discount rate (effectively the expected rate of return) of a portfolio of wind assets held in a listed investment trust managed by Schroders Greencoat, which shows that the rate today is at a higher level than it has been over the past 10 years. Given a relatively consistent risk profile over that time, especially over the past three to four years, this rise has primarily been driven by two key factors. The first is increasing bond yields, which necessitate higher returns to maintain risk-adjusted premiums over risk-free rates (returns from low-risk treasury bonds). The second, equally important, factor is this market dynamic between buyers and sellers. Sustainability risks and benefits The third reason is that we believe that there are environmental and sustainability benefits to investing in energy transition. Regardless of an individual’s stance on climate change and net zero, it’s nearly impossible to dispute that it is a key trend significantly influencing economies, markets, and both domestic and global politics. Crucially, the path to net zero is often drawn by economists as a straight line, but those who follow history will recognise that any economic transformation is not without its volatility; it is likely that there will be “energy-transition shocks” along the way. In those times, which are likely to lead to energy prices and inflationary spikes, energy-transition assets are positioned to perform well. A recent example of this occurred in 2022, when as a result of the Russia/Ukraine conflict and related energy security issues, we observed global spikes in power prices and inflation. Energy-transition infrastructure strategies performed positively, while other asset classes generally struggled – and equities and bonds both recorded negative returns for the first time in half a century. In conclusion, energy transition offers exposures and risk premia that are materially different in a portfolio context, including diversified infrastructure. These exposures translate into a very low correlation between underlying returns and the drivers of returns, even if historical risk and return metrics have been broadly similar. Moreover, there is potential for the unique return drivers within the energy-transition infrastructure to produce outperformance as the global energy transition evolves.

AP As India progresses toward its ambitious renewable energy goals, the upcoming Union Budget holds significant potential to pave the way for a more sustainable and energy-secure future. The renewable energy sector is a cornerstone of India’s climate commitments, with the nation striving to achieve 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030. However, realizing this vision requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses challenges in domestic manufacturing, import dependency, policy predictability, and stakeholder collaboration. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD One of the most pressing issues in the renewable energy landscape is the delicate balance between imposing duties on imports and fostering a robust domestic manufacturing ecosystem. Recent government measures, such as Basic Customs Duty (BCD) on imported solar modules and cells, aim to reduce dependency on foreign markets. However, the timing and quantum of such duties must be carefully calibrated to avoid supply chain disruptions. While these duties incentivise domestic production, they also raise project costs in the short term, potentially delaying adoption. To counterbalance this, the government must extend and strengthen schemes like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) to provide a competitive edge to Indian manufacturers.

However, to truly match global competition, further investment in research and development (R&D) is essential. Domestic players must be equipped with the technology and innovation to produce high-efficiency solar cells, modules, and wind turbines at competitive costs. The budget should allocate dedicated funds for renewable energy R&D, enabling India to leapfrog in global energy technology leadership. While policies governing the renewable energy sector have significantly evolved, further refinement is required to enhance their structure, predictability, and transparency. Stakeholders, including consumers, discoms (distribution companies), transmission companies, and financiers, thrive in an environment of clarity and trust. Policies must be aligned with the realities of implementation, offering scalability and mitigating risks for investors. For instance, ensuring clear guidelines on open access charges and timely approvals for projects will foster confidence among developers and financiers alike. Impact Shorts More Shorts Chennai Ranks #1 in Challan Checks: ACKO Insights for Smarter Car and Two Wheeler Insurance Decisions Tata Harrier EV vs Mahindra XEV 9e: Design and road presence compared Uniform state policies will play a pivotal role in achieving widespread renewable energy adoption. India’s federal structure often results in varying regulations across states, creating challenges for developers operating nationwide. The budget should encourage states to harmonise their renewable energy policies, including measures such as standardized net metering frameworks and streamlined energy banking mechanisms. Simplified and investor-friendly policies will reduce barriers to adoption, benefiting both consumers and businesses. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD An often-overlooked aspect of renewable energy adoption is the importance of round-the-clock (RTC) power. Integrating renewables into the grid at scale necessitates advancements in storage technology and ancillary services. Pro-consumer measures like energy banking and open access charges can provide the flexibility needed for RTC power availability. Similarly, extending subsidies or tax incentives for energy storage solutions will accelerate their adoption, enabling a more reliable and resilient renewable energy ecosystem. Achieving India’s renewable energy aspirations will require unprecedented collaboration among stakeholders. Consumers need access to affordable and clean energy, discoms must embrace innovative business models, transmission companies must modernize infrastructure, and financiers must deploy patient capital for long-term gains. Public-private partnerships can catalyze this ecosystem, providing the necessary resources and expertise to overcome current challenges. India’s renewable energy journey is also a critical component of its economic growth story. The sector has the potential to generate millions of jobs, enhance energy security, and reduce carbon emissions. By addressing key bottlenecks in manufacturing, policy clarity, and state-level coordination, the Union Budget can lay a strong foundation for the next phase of India’s energy transformation. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Accelerating the adoption of renewable energy requires a delicate balance between imposing duties to curb imports and fostering a robust domestic manufacturing ecosystem. Incentivizing domestic manufacturers through PLI and R&D investments is crucial to match global competition. Uniform state policies and support for RTC power are equally critical to streamline implementation and drive widespread adoption. In conclusion, the upcoming budget must be visionary yet pragmatic, addressing immediate challenges while laying the groundwork for long-term sustainability. A structured and collaborative approach will ensure that India not only meets its renewable energy targets but also becomes a global leader in clean energy innovation.

Wright, the CEO of Liberty Energy who was nominated by President-elect Donald Trump, faced questions about his past statements on climate change and his approach to the energy transition. In a nearly three-hour hearing marked by occasional climate protests and pointed questions about his views on wildfires and climate change, Wright described himself as a \"science geek turned tech nerd turned lifelong energy entrepreneur.\" His nomination comes at a time when electricity demand is projected to grow by 15% in the next five years, driven by artificial intelligence technologies and increased manufacturing. Key Takeaways 1. Wright displayed a nuanced stance on renewables. Despite initial skepticism from some committee members about his commitment to renewable energy, Wright worked to present a more balanced perspective. His background in multiple energy sectors, including early work in solar energy and current investments in geothermal and nuclear technology, became a recurring theme throughout the hearing. \"I worked on solar energy at UC Berkeley,\" Wright told senators, noting that his company Liberty Energy has partnerships in \"next-generation geothermal and has partnerships in next-generation nuclear energy and new battery technology.\" When pressed by Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) about past statements suggesting renewables would remain in \"single digits\" globally, Wright clarified he was referring to total global energy consumption rather than electricity generation, acknowledging the significant growth of renewables in U.S. power generation. 2. Wright emphasized that the DOE under his leadership will focus on innovation and technology. He positioned technological advancement as central to his vision for the department, particularly in addressing climate challenges. Throughout his testimony, he emphasized the critical role of innovation in meeting America's energy needs. \"The solution to climate change is to evolve our energy system,\" Wright said. \"Are there things we can do – investments together through the Department of Energy – to accelerate development of new energy technologies that are really the only pathway to address climate change? Absolutely.\" He showed particular enthusiasm for geothermal energy, describing it as having \"tremendous potential\" and explaining how new technologies could unlock heat resources \"below everyone's feet.\" 3. Wright emphasized that he will seek a balance between environment and affordability. A significant portion of the hearing focused on Wright's approach to balancing environmental concerns with economic realities. He repeatedly emphasized the need to consider both climate impacts and energy affordability. \"Ten percent of Americans got a disconnection notice to their utilities in the last 12 months,\" Wright noted in his closing remarks. \"More than 20 percent of Americans report struggles paying their bills, whether it's paying their energy bills, whether it's filling their car with gas or heating their home or paying their electricity bill.\" He also repeatedly acknowledged climate change as \"a real and global phenomenon,\" while arguing for a comprehensive approach to energy policy that maintains reliability and affordability while reducing emissions through technological innovation. 4. Wright emphasized that nuclear energy is a key priority. Nuclear energy emerged as a key priority in Wright's vision for America's energy future. His enthusiasm for both traditional and new nuclear technologies was evident throughout the hearing. \"The United States invented the technology of nuclear first for abrupt-action weapons and then for commercial nuclear power. Of course, we should lead in that,\" Wright said. He expressed concern about America's diminished uranium enrichment capabilities and voiced strong support for small modular reactors (SMRs), suggesting they could help overcome the cost and construction time challenges that have hindered nuclear expansion. 5. Wright noted that national labs will drive the research agenda of the U.S. Wright repeatedly emphasized the crucial role of scientific research in advancing America's energy goals. The Department of Energy's national laboratory system featured prominently in his vision for the agency's future. \"Our labs have been pioneers in energy innovation across the spectrum,\" Wright said. He committed to keeping the labs \"focused and energized to work on science -- basic fundamental science but also science will someday and maybe someday soon have applications to energy.\" When pressed about maintaining scientific integrity, Wright promised to \"follow the scientific method\" and ensure the publication of non-classified Department of Energy research. If confirmed, Wright would lead a department responsible for managing the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile, overseeing 17 national laboratories, and implementing and managing major clean energy programs and investments passed under the Biden administration. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources is expected to vote on Wright's nomination in the coming weeks.

View all partners DOI https://doi.org/10.64628/AAJ.f4d7cymye The world is fast transitioning towards renewable energy systems. But in many African countries, this transition is not solving historical inequalities or socio-economic challenges. This is because moving away from fossil fuels is costly and governments have largely not involved historically disadvantaged communities in the transition. Instead, African countries are focusing on how much clean energy technology costs and how to get companies to invest in it. Government and policymakers are overlooking concerns about social equity , environmental protection and political inclusion . This can lead to human rights violations and protests by communities who oppose renewable energy projects because they fear a repeat of past injustices associated with extractive projects, such as losing their land. The shift to renewable energy must be a just transition . It must not leave behind people who currently lack electricity. The justice dimension must be included in energy policies in African countries. We are research specialists in the fields of business and human rights, law and development, resource governance, energy, environment, and African development. We investigated how energy justice principles can guide and shape the green transition in Africa. These principles are geared towards the social, ethical and environmental aspects of producing, distributing and consuming energy. Energy justice sets out to ensure that energy is delivered to everyone in a sustainable way. Read more: Green energy: South Africa’s transition plan must be careful not to deepen inequality – the 3 top issues We looked at laws, articles, research databases and government reports on energy justice. We also examined reports from African countries on the just transition, on human rights-based approaches to energy and on the role of renewable energy sources in Africa today. About 600 million African people still lack access to reliable and affordable energy. Our research found that this energy poverty creates barriers to development and human rights concerns. For example, it stifles industrial growth and limits the productivity of small and medium-sized businesses. It reduces agricultural efficiency (for example, irrigation systems need energy). It reduces access to education – students study by poor lighting and have no way to charge devices. Healthcare (a lack of refrigeration for vaccines) is affected. And people don’t have clean cooking technologies like electric ovens. Our findings indicate that the transition to renewable energy must primarily aim to eradicate energy poverty. This requires careful planning, and co-operation between all organisations, communities and institutions involved in providing energy. It also needs targeted interventions to suit different African countries. Africa’s complicated energy transition Africa’s energy landscape is still shaped by inequality and exclusion that dates back to colonial times. Colonial-era infrastructure and development prioritised urban centres and extractive industries , such as coal and gold mines. Vast rural populations were deprived – and remain so. The transition must expand energy access at the same time as introducing low-carbon energy systems. This is a dual challenge which creates tensions between development needs and environmental sustainability goals. For instance, South Africa, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola rely heavily on fossil fuel revenues and extractive industries. This creates resistance to adopting renewable energy policies. Read more: South Africa's move to green energy was slowed down by government to protect coal mining When making the change, communities dependent on industries like coal mining face job losses. They have limited opportunities to find other sources of income. Workers in fossil fuel sectors lose their jobs and don’t get enough support (like training) to find other work in renewable energy. When this happens, food security and incomes are reduced, and rural poverty becomes worse. Some communities are displaced from their land to make way for big renewable energy projects. This weakens community cohesion and undermines trust in government and developers. Communities usually have little access to legal recourse or compensation when big companies expropriate land. Social justice is part of energy justice. It is essential to make a concerted and transparent effort to dismantle barriers to energy justice, to include all groups who may be at the margins of society in various ways. Unclear rules and weak government practices in many African countries also make it difficult to plan the energy transition effectively. Poor management and lack of enforcement of environmental laws add to the difficulties. Another problem is that although developed countries have pledged financial support to African nations for the transition, the amount of money they’ve disbursed has fallen short . This leaves African nations with insufficient resources to invest in renewable energy infrastructure and the just transition. How to end energy injustice Our research found that it is possible for the transition to give everyone access to clean, green energy. This will happen if governments integrate energy justice into all their energy policies. Governments can start by making sure that rural and historically disadvantaged communities are put first. African governments should reduce their dependence on extractive industries such as mining. Investing in renewable energy industries and creating new employment opportunities through green job initiatives can help with this. The impact of renewable energy projects on the environment and people must be carefully investigated. Communities need to be fully involved in planning large renewable energy projects. People who are displaced by energy projects must be compensated. The benefits of green energy must be shared with affected communities. Policymakers need to create clear, fair and enforceable rules and laws to make sure that clean energy is delivered in a just way. Stronger institutions, actions to prevent corruption, and training programmes are essential to make these rules work. Energy Peace and Security RandD Energy justice energy access Green transition"

    "article_text": "When it comes to saving money, Steph McGovern is here to help Britons switch things up at home to secure the best energy rates (Picture: Smart Energy GB) From that regular Sunday roast to our favourite Indian takeaway, you might think that Britons are creatures of habit. However, research carried out by Smart Energy GB† showed that we’re actually a nation that’s happy to switch it up for a positive outcome. And with energy prices remaining high, 64 per cent of Britons are changing their routines and becoming more flexible to save money, with 56 per cent specifically looking to save energy. An impressive 40 per cent of Britons have adapted their daily routines in the past year. Almost a quarter say they consider the time of day when doing high energy-consuming tasks, and 70 per cent have changed the way they plan their meals by doing more batch cooking. Is batch cooking the key to saving energy? 70 per cent of us swear by it, whereas others limit the number of appliances they run at the same time (Picture: Getty Images) Unsurprisingly, a majority do so to save money and energy, but many people were also happy to find that adapting their routines helped them to be more efficient and save time. Playing smart Consumer finance expert and TV presenter Steph McGovern has been working with Smart Energy GB to explore how much energy and money can be saved at home, and just how easy it can be. Energy reward schemes can suit our changing schedules and help us save money on bills. These flexible schemes can be easily accessed by households with a smart meter, and are designed to help reward customers for using energy at different times of the day. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Up Next Previous Page Next Page They’re offered by many energy providers and encourage households to shift their energy usage away from peak hours, either by rewarding them for using less energy when demand is very high or by offering cheaper energy when demand is lower. The smart meter’s handy display helps households keep a close eye on what they’re spending on energy (Picture: Smart Energy GB) If you have a smart meter installed, the financial benefit is clear, with many households believing they save up to £140 in a year by having one in their home. ‘I always want to make sure that I’m helping people make their money work harder for them, and it’s something I’m conscious of implementing in my own life too,’ said Steph. ‘It can be easy to put off these admin jobs like getting a smart meter, but it’s clear that by opening up access to reward schemes, there is a whole world of opportunities for saving.’ Six ways to save If you’re looking to join the flexible Britons who are switching up their routines to enjoy energy savings, here are some key changes that Steph suggests so you can enjoy keeping more of that hard-earned money in your account. 1. Get a smart meter The first step to saving energy is becoming more aware of how much you’re using – something the smart meter was designed to help you with (Picture: Smart Energy GB) Your smart meter display shows you how much energy your household uses in near-real time. Checking it regularly is a quick and easy way to track usage, identify power-hungry appliances and stay on top of your bills. 2. Sign up for a reward scheme With a smart meter, you could be eligible to sign up for a reward scheme from your energy supplier and benefit from extra savings. They will alert you when you can take part, so you can move your energy-intensive chores to a different time. Nearly nine in ten (87 per cent) of people who are taking part in an energy reward scheme say they are saving money on their bills. 3. Batch cook Appliances like ovens can use up a lot of energy. Batch cooking food together, when you have the oven on, means you can minimise usage and reduce energy consumption. 4. Time your laundry Modern washing machines often feature built-in timers, allowing users to schedule cycles during off-peak energy hours (Picture: Smart Energy GB) Most washing machines these days come with built-in timers. If you’re taking part in an energy reward scheme, you can easily load up the machine and set it to start operating only when cheaper, off-peak energy rates come into effect. In fact, nearly half of Britons say they are open to being more flexible when it comes to when they do their laundry. 5. Use more efficient appliances It might be time for an upgrade. Older machines are usually less efficient and consume more energy. If an old appliance has come to the end of its life, check the energy efficiency rating of any replacements and choose the most efficient you can. The extra investment will soon pay for itself. 6. Remember to adjust your heating It’s surprising how quickly the little things can add up! Make sure you turn the heating down or even off when you’re not going to be at home. Timer devices can help with this or, if you have a smart home set-up, you can easily control your heating – and even lighting and appliances – flexibly from wherever you are. Want to keep a closer eye on your usage? Get a smart meter today! * Here’s how we save London couple Michael and Johnny save money by taking part in their supplier’s energy reward scheme (Picture: Smart Energy GB) Steph visited two households to learn about their strategies for saving energy and reducing monthly bills. Michael and Johnny from London, save on their bills and get rewards and vouchers for using energy more flexibly. ‘It’s super easy and straightforward,’ Michael explained. ‘We get a notification via the app, I’ll put it in our diary to say electricity is going to be cheaper at this time, and then we’ll know to plan around it.’ ‘We were already tracking our energy usage with our smart meter display,’ added Johnny. ‘But now we know when to spend and when to save. When we get the notification, it’s ‘go time’; we charge the car, put the dishwasher on and do some batch baking. We just run the house so much more efficiently.’ Steph also met housemates Felicia and Naiema, also from London, who are reward scheme converts. Felicia, the ‘discount queen,’ and Naiema embrace saving energy and earning rewards with enthusiasm (Picture: Smart Energy GB) Felicia wished she had found out about them earlier. ‘I would have been the first person to sign up. I’m a discount queen!’ she said. Naiema added: ‘We already do things to save energy, like making sure wash loads are full and cooking together, but we could definitely be more flexible and take advantage of a reward scheme.’ Find more money-saving tips at SmartEnergyGB.org †Research conducted by OnePoll across 2,000 UK adults, December 2024. *Eligibility may vary.

That's according to a new survey by Energy News Bulletin - the APAC region's most comprehensive source of daily energy news - who have surveyed their readers on attitudes towards nuclear power in Australia . The headline finding in the Future of Energy: Nuclear power in Australia report is that more than three quarters (78.5%) want to see nuclear energy as part of the country's before 2050 and just over two thirds (67%) see nuclear energy becoming a part of Australia's energy mix in the next 25 years. Russell Yeo , Energy News Bulletin's managing editor, says those working within the energy resources sectors - some of the most engaged and informed people in the country on the issue of nuclear energy - have spoken clearly on their support for the divisive energy option. \"We compared these figures to the findings of similar, recently conducted surveys of the Australian population and found support for nuclear energy is higher in the energy sector. Get the latest news delivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy . \"Polls varies but our figure of 78.5% is noticeably higher than 61% found in a recent Lowy Institute survey,\" he said. In the wake of Peter Dutton releasing the costings for his nuclear energy policy, the ENB survey found eight in ten think the Albanese government's opposition to nuclear power in Australia is mainly ideological, against less than a fifth (15.8%) saying it's an economic objection. Similarly, just over two thirds (70.8%) think the Australian general population's opposition to nuclear power in Australia is mainly ideological.

    "article_text": "3 household appliances you should not leave on standby — they increase your energy bills Leaving certain appliances on standby can still consume electricity What's On Angela Patrone Senior Lifestyle Reporter 13:38, 27 Jan 2025 View Image These three household appliances should not be left on standby — they increase your energy bills (Image: (Image: Getty)) Energy bills have been fluctuating wildly over the past two years. Although they've retreated from the record highs of late 2023 and early 2024, they remain steep and unaffordable for many. ‌ One common household habit that could be preventing maximum savings on energy bills is leaving certain appliances on standby. ‌ Even when not in use, some devices can continue to draw electricity if left plugged in - with some being more culpable than others, reports the Express . ‌ The energy experts at Free Heating Scheme have identified three appliances that should \"never be left on standby mode\". In this context, 'standby' refers to appliances being left plugged in with the socket switched on. They explained: \"Leaving devices on standby may seem like a time-saver, but it can steadily consume energy and drive up your electricity bills. Although standby mode uses less power than when a device is fully operational, many appliances still draw electricity even when they appear to be off. Over time, this hidden energy use can accumulate, contributing to the escalating energy costs many households are grappling with this winter.\" 1. Satellite boxes Satellite boxes are commonplace appliances that can have a \"surprising impact\" on your energy bills. Despite having a standby mode designed to minimise power consumption, these devices still \"draw a significant amount of energy even when not in active use\". ‌ Many people think that leaving their satellite box on standby is enough, but just turning off the TV and keeping the box in standby mode can \"result in unnecessary energy consumption\" which adds up over time. Satellite boxes can be \"big energy drainers\", and properly turning them off when not needed can lead to a \"noticeable reduction in your energy bill\". 2. Desktop computers Leaving a desktop computer in standby might make for quicker log-ins, yet it can also \"drive up your energy costs\". Pros caution that \"Even in standby, desktop computers consume electricity, which can become expensive with time.\" ‌ On average, a desktop on standby could increase your electricity bill by about £10 to £15 every year. Though this might not seem much, completely switching off your desktop when not in use can add up to meaningful savings. Such small behavioural adjustments can impact your total energy bills significantly. 3. Games consoles Modern gaming consoles are designed with energy-saving features, but they still have disadvantages. These systems usually include an on/off button that puts them into a low-power standby state. Article continues below Nonetheless, many users either forget to power down their consoles entirely or leave them on whilst turning off the TV, resulting in avoidable energy expenses. Experts suggest that games consoles can account for around six percent of the average household's energy bill. Although the percentage may not seem significant, regularly switching off your console can lead to considerable savings over time. The Energy Saving Trust also recommends keeping your console up-to-date, as this can enhance its energy efficiency."

Chief executive Nigel Pocklington stated: \"Today we have an opportunity with a partner that shares our sustainable energy vision and has the resources to accelerate our purpose substantially.\" ‌ He added that while the board remains confident in Good Energy's strategy as a publicly listed company, Esyasoft's financial resources and presence in new markets significantly enhance their potential. Juliet Davenport, Good Energy's founder and former chief executive, reflected on the company's 25-year history, saying: \"I founded Good Energy 25 years ago to be a pioneer in the provision of clean power to all customers in the UK.\" She noted the vast changes in the energy industry since then, which was previously dominated by fossil fuels and a centralized system. Good Energy, a UK-based renewable energy company, is on the brink of a significant expansion with a new investor that could revolutionise its clean power offerings. ‌ \"This new investor for Good Energy offers an opportunity to scale the Good Energy propositions leading the decentralised and flexible clean power offering for the prosumers of the future to make a real difference to climate change.\" While shareholder approval is pending, if the deal gets the nod, it's expected to be finalised in the first half of 2025. Esyasoft, the potential investor, touts itself as a pioneer in \"smart grid\" technology , employing artificial intelligence and data-driven tech to upgrade the electricity grid. According to previous stock exchange disclosures, Esyasoft falls under the control of the Abu Dhabi International Holding Company (IHC), chaired by Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who is part of the UAE founder's family and the Abu Dhabi Royal family. ‌ Established in 1999, Good Energy has grown to serve around 275,000 customers across the UK. Although not one of the Big Six energy firms, Good Energy's directors were involved in discussions with Labour’s energy consumers minister, Miatta Fahnbulleh, at the end of August, focusing on how companies can assist bill-payers amid rising energy costs. The announcement of the deal sent Good Energy's shares soaring by 22% on Monday morning, adding to a nearly 65% rise over the past six months, largely attributed to Esyasoft's expressed interest in acquiring a stake in the company. Bipin Chandra, the brain behind Esyasoft and its chief executive, has expressed his company's commitment to aiding businesses that are crucial in energy infrastructures and climate technology sectors. He said: \"We have a strong track record of supporting businesses involved in critical energy infrastructure and climate technologies, and therefore our portfolio of services is highly complementary to Good Energy’s. Article continues below \"We believe that, through our strategic partnership, we can support Good Energy in accelerating delivery of its purpose and growth ambitions by realising the extensive opportunities that exist for this business both in the UK and internationally.\" His words reflect not only Esyasoft's robust experience but also its eagerness to work alongside Good Energy, tapping into the enormous potential for expansion within and beyond the UK."

With an ambitious target of achieving 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, this year’s budget must set a bold and actionable roadmap to overcome current challenges while laying the foundation for long-term growth. This is more than just a fiscal exercise—it is a decisive step in reshaping the way India powers its industries, cities and villages in alignment with economic progress and environmental responsibility. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Ambition meets infrastructure India’s renewable energy ambition is unparalleled, but the scale of transformation required is equally daunting. To achieve its 2030 target, the country must triple its annual capacity additions from the current 28 GW to 50–60 GW. However, infrastructure limitations, particularly in transmission and power evacuation, threaten to slow progress. More from Business Hyundai India’s Rs 27,870 crore IPO oversubscribed by 2.28X, largely driven by institutional investors How Indian fintech startups are driving Malaysia’s UPI-like digital payments revolution The Green Energy Corridor (GEC) Phase III is pivotal in addressing these challenges. Renewable- rich states like Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are central to India’s energy transition, but power evacuation infrastructure in these states remains underdeveloped. By prioritizing investments in interstate transmission systems, the budget can ensure seamless power flow from generation hubs to consumption centers. Additionally, subsidies for smart grid technologies and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) will be critical to managing grid stability as renewable energy’s share in the energy mix increases. Strengthening domestic manufacturing India’s vision of becoming a self-reliant energy powerhouse and global manufacturing hub hinges on building a robust domestic manufacturing ecosystem. While the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme has bolstered solar panel and module production, it must now extend to upstream components such as polysilicon, wafers, and solar glass. This will reduce dependency on imports, lower costs, and create employment opportunities while positioning India to serve worldwide demand for renewable energy components.

Rationalising customs duties on raw materials and standardizing GST rates for renewable energy equipment will further enhance the financial viability of domestic manufacturing. By fostering innovation and creating a competitive ecosystem, India can secure its position as a global leader in renewable energy production and emerge as a key supplier to meet international clean energy requirements. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD The role of green hydrogen As the global energy landscape evolves, green hydrogen has emerged as a key player in decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors like steel, cement, and long-haul transportation. India has the potential to lead this revolution, but its green hydrogen ecosystem is still in its infancy. The Union Budget 2025 must allocate significant resources to accelerate green hydrogen adoption. Targeted subsidies, pilot projects, and infrastructure investments will help scale production and reduce costs. Beyond its environmental benefits, green hydrogen represents an economic opportunity, capable of generating jobs, attracting foreign investment, and positioning India as a global hub for clean energy technologies. Tackling energy storage and grid stability Energy storage is no longer an option, it is an essential component of India’s renewable energy future. Solar and wind power’s inherent intermittency requires advanced storage solutions to ensure a reliable power supply. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) can stabilize the grid and enable efficient integration of renewable energy into the power system. The government must introduce subsidies and tax incentives for large-scale BESS projects. Coupled with investments in DISCOM modernization and digital solutions like AI-powered smart meters, these measures can reduce transmission and distribution losses while improving overall efficiency. Strengthening the grid’s resilience is key to supporting India’s renewable energy ambitions. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Unlocking rooftop solar potential Rooftop solar represents a tremendous opportunity for decentralized clean energy generation. However, its adoption has been hampered by regulatory hurdles and limited financial support. The budget must address these challenges by simplifying approval processes, providing financing options, and removing state-imposed caps on rooftop solar capacity for industrial establishments. Incentives for battery-backed rooftop solar systems can further increase their appeal, offering both energy independence and grid support. Expanding rooftop solar adoption across residential and commercial sectors is a low-hanging fruit in India’s energy transition. Financial support for long-term stability Achieving India’s renewable energy targets will require unprecedented financial support. Extending the concessional 15 per cent tax rate under Section 115BAB for renewable energy projects can provide developers with long-term stability. Reinstating lower withholding tax rates for external borrowings and exempting GST on Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) will reduce financial burdens and encourage investments. Further, the budget must incentivize private sector participation in transmission PGCIL) and similar initiatives could unlock latent investor interest and accelerate infrastructure development. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Green energy for a sustainable future India’s renewable energy journey is not just a story of targets and timelines—it is a vision for a sustainable and equitable future. The Union Budget 2025 offers a golden opportunity to accelerate this transition by addressing structural challenges, incentivizing clean energy solutions, and fostering innovation. From transmission infrastructure and domestic manufacturing to green hydrogen and energy storage, the budget must deliver a comprehensive strategy that balances ambition with action. This is not just about meeting the 2030 target, it is about positioning India as a global leader in clean energy, creating jobs, and building an energy ecosystem that future generations can be proud of. The time for incremental changes is over. The Union Budget 2025 must act as a blueprint for India’s green energy revolution, demonstrating that economic growth and environmental sustainability are not mutually exclusive but interdependent. By making bold choices now, India can pave the way for a cleaner, brighter future. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD The author is Chairman and Managing Director of Apollo International Group.

    "article_text": "Mario Draghi was awarded the international \"PoliTO Foresight and Innovation\" prize TURIN, Italy, Jan. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The EU-Italy Energy Days , organized by Politecnico di Torino in collaboration with the Italian Ministry for the Environment and Energy Security , and with the full support of the Italian Ministry for Universities and Research , and the European Commission, ended today with the awarding to Mario Draghi of the first international “PoliTO Foresight and Innovation” prize. The award was established by Politecnico di Torino to recognize the most exceptional European expertise in tackling the collective challenge of medium- to long-term innovation and renewal, at both the national and European levels. Professor Draghi was awarded upon the advice of the “ Energy & Climate High Level Group” . This international team of ten experts, hailing from France, Germany, Belgium, United Kingdom, Latvia, Finland, and Italy, is highly qualified in European economics, technology, law, and policy, and supports Politecnico in its mission to assist in policy-making. Professor Draghi was awarded for his extensive academic experience, his institutional assignments within Italian and European institutions, and his valuable contribution to EU innovation and competitiveness . The award ceremony crowns the two-day event organized by Politecnico for this second edition of the EU-Italy Energy Days , held on January 23 and 24, on the theme “How to Achieve Near-Zero Emissions by 2050.” A unique opportunity for key representatives from Italian ministries and European institutions to collaborate with international scientists in identifying innovative, socially acceptable, and economically viable solutions for implementing sustainable energy policies . In the impressive settings of the Valentino Castle – Politecnico’s historical venue – and of the National Museum of the Risorgimento, hosted in Palazzo Carignano, the program featured international experts from academia, industry and policymakers in critical discussions on topical issues, such as nuclear energy, hydrogen and CCS technologies, alternative fuels for transportation and renewable energy. Science plays a crucial role in supporting the European Commission’s “Energy and Climate” group, and key decision-makers among the member states such as Italy. Indeed, the main goals set by the President of the “ Von der Leyen II Commission\" for the “Energy and Climate” group are aimed at ensuring the EU's future competitiveness through effective decarbonization , identifying numerous goals for both energy and climate commissioners, including reviewing fiscal policies, following up on National Energy and Climate Plans, and formulating policies for 2030. EU-Italy Energy Days international meeting aims precisely to connect research, institutions and policy makers on these issues. This is why four panel discussions were held on Thursday, January 23 rd : “Nuclear Energy: Innovative Technologies and Prospects”; “Planning National Strategies for Hydrogen and CCS”; “Decarbonization in Transportation”; “Innovative Strategies to Promote the Energy Transition.” On Friday, January 24 th , greetings were held by Politecnico’s Rector Stefano Corgnati , Symposium Chairman Giovanni Federigo De Santi , Piedmont Region Vice President Elena Chiorino, and Turin’s Mayor Stefano Lo Russo . Then, the European Parliament member and ITRE Committee Vice Chairman Giorgio Gori , together with the Minister of the Environment and Energy Security Gilberto Pichetto Fratin launched the debate on “ Energy Transition: priorities in the European and Italian policy agenda”. The concluding panel entitled “ Energy Transition: Italian perspectives and future plans in the European context” hosted internationally renowned guests, with representatives from the corporate world and institutions. “This event aligns with one of the main objectives of our Strategic Plan, that is Politecnico di Torino's growing role in facilitating the dialogue on nowadays technological transformations, increasingly pervasive in our society. During the two-day “EU-ITALY Energy Days,” we eased discussions between the European Commission and the Ministry of Environment and Energy Security, together with academia and industry, thus playing a facilitating role for policy making,” comments Politecnico di Torino Rector Stefano Corgnati . “I am grateful for the invitation to this Symposium, which fosters a close dialogue between our country and the European Commission, and has been hosted by Politecnico di Torino, a top-level institution for transition technologies,” says Minister for the Environment and Energy Security Gilberto Pichetto Fratin , “This meeting is a key opportunity to discuss a crucial issue: how to successfully address the energy transition, maintaining economic competitiveness and ensuring energy supply security. Achieving the Net Zero goal in 2050 means sustainably decarbonizing the economy while ensuring the safety of energy supplies. In the nuclear field, I just submitted a few days ago to the Prime Minister's Office a draft bill to create a stable and investment-friendly regulatory framework. This draft law calls for the adoption of a National Sustainable Nuclear Program aimed at decarbonization, system stability and reduced energy costs for households and businesses. Our goal is clear: to build an energy system that is secure, resilient and competitive, responding to global challenges and enhancing Italian excellence. We are working to achieve all this .” “It is crucial to me that the debate of this two-day event in Turin focused on new technologies leading towards our country’s energy transition: from the new generation of nuclear power, with a key project developed right here in Turin, to the production of green hydrogen, up to the development of CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage)” - adds Giorgio Gori , European Parliament member and ITRE Committee Vice Chairman – “ All this said, the most pressing challenge that the European Union needs to face is the reduction of the energy costs. On February 26 th , the EU Commission will present the Action Plan to Ensure Affordable Energy Prices. I trust that this plan will include concrete and effective measures to support households and businesses, promoting an inclusive and fair energy transition. In Italy, this challenge is even more demanding. Our country, with its heavy dependence on gas, is paying a very high price for soaring energy costs. The situation is unsustainable and requires rapid and effective responses. The goal is to differentiate the price of energy from the price of gas, which in Italy determines 70 percent of the cost. The way is to increase the production of renewable energy – reducing the use of gas – and to promote a greater diffusion of long-term contracts. For all this, a key role can be played by the GSE.” For more information: Press Office LaPresse - ufficio.stampa@lapresse.it A photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/89254b2b-b06f-4e8e-939e-f175685fb8ff"

Esyasoft's new offer for the Chippenham, England-based renewable electricity supplier and energy services provider is 490 pence per share in cash. It values Good Energy's equity at GBP99.4 million and implies an enterprise value of GBP67.8 million. In October, Esyasoft had made an approach at 412p per share. Good Energy said that tilt \"was not a fair reflection of the future growth opportunities of the company\". The new offer is a 66% premium to Good Energy's share price of 295p before Esyasoft's approach in October and 24% above Friday's close. Early Monday, Good Energy shares were up 21% to 476.52p. Esyasoft's new bid already has received the backing of 30% of Good Energy's shareholders. \"The Good Energy board believes the cash offer from Esyasoft would provide Good Energy shareholders with an immediate realisation of this future value potential in cash at an attractive premium,\" the company said. Abu Dhabi-based Esyasoft is an 'energy-as-a-service' business, serving the power, water and gas market with its Smart Meter Data Management platform. It is part of the Dubai-headquartered Esyasoft Group, which makes 'internet of things' devices and software for energy distribution and management. Esyasoft Group in turn is owned by Sirius International Holdings Ltd, a subsidiary of International Holding Co PJSC, both holding companies based in Abu Dhabi. \"What strikes us about Good Energy is how aligned it is both strategically and culturally with our own business,\" said Esyasoft Holding Chief Executive Officer & Founder Bipin Chandra. \"Good Energy, like Esyasoft, is driven by a vision to deliver a smart, green and sustainable energy future for all.\" By Tom Waite, Alliance News editor Comments and questions to newsroom@alliancenews.com Copyright 2025 Alliance News Ltd.

    "article_text": "Tinubu, other leaders tackle Africa’s energy woes in Tanzania By : Waliat Musa Date: 27 January 2025 6:17am WAT Share : President Bola Tinubu President Bola Tinubu. President Bola Tinubu has departed Abuja for Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to participate in the Africa Heads of State Energy Summit starting today. The summit, being hosted by the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania, the African Union, the African Development Bank Group (AfDB), and the World Bank Group, will bring together over 25 Heads of State and Governments, international organisations, energy experts and private sector leaders to forge a unified path toward achieving universal energy access. Tagged, Africa Energy Summit (AES), it is intended to boost universal energy access by 2030, as stakeholders gather to advance Mission 300, the organisers have said. The Vice President for Power, Energy, Climate, and Green Growth, AfDB, Kevin Kariuki, described energy as the engine of development, emphasising that without affordable, reliable, and sustainable electricity, Africa could not achieve its developmental aspirations or secure its rightful place in the global economy. He added that the success of Mission 300 is not only about electrification, but also about saving and empowering lives, transforming communities, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and safeguarding biodiversity. He pointed out that at the current pace of electrification, combined with Africa’s rapid population growth, the number of people living without access to electricity could remain largely unchanged. Kariuki emphasised that Mission 300 would provide a clear roadmap to achieve universal energy access by 2030. He mentioned that the principal outcomes of the summit included the adoption of the Dar es Salaam Energy Declaration by the entire continent and the co-creation of 12 country energy compacts between countries and the Mission 300 partners.

The twelve countries that will submit energy compacts account for almost half of the global population without access to electricity,” he stated. According to Tinubu’s spokesman, Bayo Onanuga, the President will join other African leaders, private sector leaders, development partners and civil society groups in Dar es Salaam to strategise to accelerate energy access across the continent. Onanuga stated that on the first day of the summit, Nigeria and other participating countries would present their national energy strategies, termed compacts, detailing their approaches to achieving universal energy access within five years. He stated that heads of state would endorse the Dar es Salaam Energy Declaration on the second day, outlining a unified roadmap for Africa’s progress towards the Mission 300 objectives. “President Tinubu will deliver a national statement reaffirming Nigeria’s commitment to achieving universal access to energy and its leadership role in Africa’s energy sector,” he noted. Joining the President on the trip are the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Bianca Odumegwu-Ojukwu; Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu; and the Special Adviser to the President on Energy, Olu Verheijen.

    "article_text": "American energy needed to ‘lift up’ those who want to expand economically worldwide By Dave Avelia, Real Clear Wire January 26, 2025 For years, the debate surrounding America’s energy future has been obscured by politics, lip service, and hyperbole. The fact is at the heart of the “energy issue” is the question of human prosperity. How can we ensure that human beings are given the best chance to achieve their goals, better their situation, and provide for their families? Chris Wright isn’t just an advocate for responsible energy policy – he’s an advocate for humanity. He understands that energy is the foundation for any measurable advancements that lift-up the impoverished, feed the hungry, and shelter the homeless. Clean water, reliable food sources, and robust infrastructural improvements are only possible with energy policies that focus on expanding America’s load capacity and bringing down the price for consumers and businesses alike. This is why President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Chris Wright as our next Secretary of Energy has gotten much attention. Headlines will attempt to summarize his life as a “fracking executive,” but his life’s work and governing philosophy expands far beyond such shallow analysis. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! Far from an extremist or “climate denialist,” Chris Wright has openly engaged in the discussion of how we can lessen the impact humans have on the world around us. “Climate change is a global challenge,” Wright wrote last year in Liberty Energy’s 2024 Bettering Human Lives report. Alongside his role as CEO of Liberty Energy, Wright is also on the Board of Directors for Oklo, an American company that is revolutionizing the way we think of nuclear energy with their modular “Aurora Powerhouse” reactor. He also signed on to a 2023 declaration of energy executives that urged leaders to support the development of nuclear energy, in part, to “meaningfully de-carbonize its complex energy systems without derailing global economies.” That all said, Wright has never run from fracking – hydraulic fracturing – and its benefits. Because of the adoption of that process at scale, natural gas has become the leading energy source in the U.S., leading to a 12% decline in emissions between 2005 and 2015, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration. That was reinforced by the Institute for Energy Research six years later when they found that the U.S. led the world in reduction of carbon dioxide emissions since 2005. Even the Progressive Policy Institute agreed in a study that China purchasing American natural gas (versus Russian) would reduce emissions by an average of 30%. Unlike many in DC’s chatter class, Wright deals in facts. He supports an all-of-the-above energy policy that doesn’t require government bureaucrats to pick winners and losers. He supports responsible regulations that protect our land and water without stifling innovation and increasing utility costs for the rest of us. Wright describes himself as a climate realist – somebody who understands the tradeoffs between energy and climate policy. For many Americans, it is a much-needed mindset for leading the Department of Energy. A husband, father, and avid outdoorsman (skiing, cycling, and climbing), he believes in leaving the next generation a reasonable, human-focused energy system that is focused on bringing the most amount of prosperity to the most amount of people. Recent studies show that over 1 billion people on Earth are considered to be “energy poor.” That may seem inconceivable to Americans who are exposed to electrical lines, power outlets, EV charging stations, and streetlights on a daily basis, but for those billion human beings on the planet, that means an inability to grow beyond the means they were born into and achieve their potential. That’s where the continued expansion of American energy resources can continue to play a role. By unleashing American energy, we lift up those who need clean, reliable, and affordable fuel to expand economically. For human prosperity, this U.S. Senate should promptly confirm Chris Wright as our country’s next Energy Secretary. David Avella is GOPAC Chairman.

    "article_text": "Oil is a volatile commodity, a fact that needs to be taken into consideration when buying an oil-related stock. However, there are different ways to view this fact from an investment perspective. Chevron ( CVX +0.26% ) , Devon Energy ( DVN +3.61% ) , and TotalEnergies ( TTE +1.64% ) offer three very different ways to dip your toes into oil stocks if you have $200, or more, to put to work. Here's a quick look at each one. 1. Chevron covers all the carbon energy bases Chevron is what is known as an integrated energy major. That means it invests in the upstream (oil and natural gas production), midstream (pipeline), and downstream (chemical and refining) segments of the broader energy industry . This diversification helps to even out earnings in what is a very volatile sector because each segment of the industry operates just a little bit differently. For example, when oil prices are low and the upstream business is suffering, the downstream businesses will be benefiting from low input costs. Expand NYSE : CVX Chevron Today's Change ( 0.26 %) $ 0.40 Current Price $ 156.05 Key Data Points Market Cap $313B Day's Range $ 155.90 - $ 157.99 52wk Range $ 132.04 - $ 168.96 Volume 214K Avg Vol 7.4M Gross Margin 13.60 % Dividend Yield 0.04 % While Chevron's diversification across the energy sector doesn't mitigate the impact that oil price swings have on the top and bottom line, it does soften the swings. That, along with the company's focus on having a strong balance sheet , have helped it survive through industry downturns while continuing to reward investors with dividend increases all along the way. Chevron's dividend has been increased annually for 37 consecutive years, which is pretty incredible given the wild oil price swings that have occurred over that span. If you want a reliable, high-yield energy stock (Chevron's yield is 4% today), Chevron is probably one of the best options out there. 2. Devon Energy is anything but reliable While Chevron is focused on consistency, Devon Energy offers pretty much the exact opposite. This company is focused on the U.S. upstream sector, producing oil and natural gas in key domestic energy basins. With no other businesses to offset the inherent volatility of selling these commodities, Devon's top and bottom lines are highly variable. That, in turn, leads the stock to rise and fall in dramatic fashion, moving right along with the big swings in energy prices. While it isn't a great idea to try to time markets, if you have a constructive view of oil prices, Devon Energy is likely to lead to more upside than investing in Chevron would. That said, remember that there's more downside risk, as well. Expand NYSE : DVN Devon Energy Today's Change ( 3.61 %) $ 1.23 Current Price $ 35.15 Key Data Points Market Cap $21B Day's Range $ 34.11 - $ 35.58 52wk Range $ 25.89 - $ 39.74 Volume 486K Avg Vol 7.3M Gross Margin 23.20 % Dividend Yield 0.03 % While this big-picture dynamic is likely to be the driving force when making an investment in Devon Energy, there are other factors of note. Devon Energy is a well-respected company with operations in multiple regions of the United States. It has an investment-grade-rated balance sheet, 10+ years of drilling inventory, and a low break-even point, so it can make money even if oil prices are a little weak. So buying Devon Energy isn't like throwing caution to the wind. It is more like making an educated bet on higher energy prices that won't likely fall to zero if you are wrong. 3. TotalEnergies is for investors that want to hedge their bets TotalEnergies competes directly with Chevron, since both are globally diversified integrated energy giants. Chevron is probably a better choice for most investors given that it has a more impressive dividend history. However, TotalEnergies has one very important thing that Chevron largely lacks: material exposure to electricity and clean energy . The company's integrated power division, as it is called, made up around 10% of adjusted net operating income through the first nine months of 2024. This figure grew 20% year over year. Expand NYSE : TTE TotalEnergies Today's Change ( 1.64 %) $ 1.03 Current Price $ 63.96 Key Data Points Market Cap $136B Day's Range $ 63.72 - $ 64.23 52wk Range $ 52.78 - $ 65.76 Volume 1M Avg Vol 1.3M Gross Margin 12.55 % Dividend Yield 0.06 % TotalEnergies has made a material commitment to clean energy, which offers a hedge of sorts for investors that are worried about the future of carbon fuels. But what's really notable about this is that TotalEnergies made this shift without cutting its dividend, which is what European peers BP and Shell did when they made similar clean energy commitments in 2020. Even more interesting, BP and Shell have started to walk back those commitments while TotalEnergies has continued to push forward. With an attractive 5.5% dividend yield , TotalEnergies is a good choice for investors looking for more than just oil. Three ways to play oil There's no single right way to invest in oil stocks -- use the way that makes the most sense to you. Chevron is a great choice if you simply want to buy and hold a diversified energy stock with an attractive yield and reliable dividend. Devon Energy is appropriate for more aggressive investors that think oil prices are heading higher. And TotalEnergies is a good call for investors that want oil exposure, but think that clean energy is going to be an increasingly important part of the global energy pie."

Even more interesting, BP and Shell have started to walk back those commitments while TotalEnergies has continued to push forward. With an attractive 5.5% dividend yield , TotalEnergies is a good choice for investors looking for more than just oil. Three ways to play oil There's no single right way to invest in oil stocks -- use the way that makes the most sense to you. Chevron is a great choice if you simply want to buy and hold a diversified energy stock with an attractive yield and reliable dividend. Devon Energy is appropriate for more aggressive investors that think oil prices are heading higher. And TotalEnergies is a good call for investors that want oil exposure, but think that clean energy is going to be an increasingly important part of the global energy pie."

    "article_text": "Yahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article. This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways Analysis of the levelized cost of energy shows how renewables have become more cost-efficient every year. Today, the least-expensive way to meet energy needs is with renewable resources. For industries at risk of power outages or those requiring always-on power, clean energy projects can offer a lifeline. Fundamentally, distributed energy resources (DERs) can give organizations a hedge against increasing energy costs, helping meet decarbonization goals and enabling cost-effective and sustainable electrification. Further, microgrid systems that balance how, when, and where electricity is used enable greater control over energy infrastructure. These systems often integrate existing onsite energy sources with DERs and storage—providing affordable power when energy prices are high, bolstering resilience when the grid is down, powering increasing electrical loads and reducing carbon footprint. Want to learn more about DERs and the decentralization of power generation. Read \" Central Theme for Energy's Future: Decentralizing Power Generation \" in the January 2025 issue of POWER . A prime example of this approach is the clean energy microgrid project completed last year at Eaton's Arecibo, Puerto Rico, manufacturing facility, where the company produces circuit breakers for residential, commercial, and industrial applications. This microgrid is a first-of-its-kind in Puerto Rico, and it significantly reduces the facility’s carbon footprint while enhancing energy resilience and supporting local infrastructure. [caption id=\"attachment_228216\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] The clean energy microgrid project was built by Eaton in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, in collaboration with Enel North America. It incorporates 5 MWac of solar photovoltaic panels, about 1.1 MW of battery storage, and existing onsite generators, at the manufacturing facility. Courtesy: Eaton [/caption] Eaton in September 2024 received the \"International Energy Project of the Year\" award from the Association of Energy Engineers (AEE) for the Arecibo project. An important first step of this project was simply reducing how much energy was consumed at the site. By implementing comprehensive energy efficiency measures, Eaton achieved a remarkable 45% reduction in energy usage at the plant. The addition of a solar-plus-storage microgrid improved the company's control over energy supply and costs. Collectively, these initiatives are significantly boosting Eaton's energy resilience, cutting carbon emissions and lowering energy expenditures by nearly 20%. [caption id=\"attachment_228217\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] The microgrid system at Eaton's Arecibo manufacturing facility incorporates solar plus storage, as well as the company's existing onsite generators to create robust energy infrastructure that’s designed to withstand the impact from extreme weather events. The company won the 2024 \"International Energy Project of the Year\" award from the Association of Energy Engineers for the clean energy project at its Arecibo facility. Courtesy: Eaton [/caption] The microgrid currently meets more than half of the facility's energy needs. It incorporates 5 MW (MWac) of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity and about 1.1 MW of battery storage, tying directly into existing onsite generators. This architecture can generate nearly 10 GWh of renewable energy annually, and prevents the release of about 7,100 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year. A key feature of this microgrid is its ability to balance electricity consumption based on real-time demand, providing greater control over onsite energy resources. This includes the ability to operate independently from the grid, ensuring continuous power supply during outages. [caption id=\"attachment_228218\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Eaton manufacturers circuit breakers used in homes, buildings and industrial applications at its facility in Arecibo, Puerto Rico. Courtesy: Eaton [/caption] The microgrid is also engineered to withstand Category 5 hurricane-force winds, which was an integral design consideration for the island location. Further, in normal grid-connected conditions, the system can generate renewable energy that not only serves Eaton's facility but also feeds back into the local grid, reducing the burden on Puerto Rico's utility infrastructure. Following the success of the Arecibo project, Eaton is moving forward with a second microgrid at the company's Las Piedras manufacturing facility to further enhance energy resilience across the island. The need for sustainable, resilient, and cost-effective energy solutions is more pressing than ever. Projects like the Arecibo microgrid serve as a blueprint for integrating clean energy into industrial operations, benefiting both businesses and the communities they serve. As organizations increasingly electrify their operations and expand electric vehicle charging infrastructure, microgrids can often provide the necessary onsite capacity additions quickly and cost-effectively, especially when government funding and tax incentive programs are available. Successful clean energy initiatives require meticulous planning and stakeholder collaboration, including technology providers, financing partners and local utilities. There is no universal solution or \"one-size-fits-all\" approach for modernizing and decarbonizing energy systems. Tailored strategies that align with specific organizational goals are essential. Establishing clear operational goals and maintenance responsibilities from the outset is also critical for long-term success. Eaton focuses on clean energy projects that maximize impact, especially in regions where energy sources remain heavily reliant on fossil fuels. These initiatives not only help manage energy costs but also support the company's operational and regulatory objectives. Deployment of clean energy resources is not just a forward-thinking strategy, it is part of doing business right, providing organizations a competitive advantage. As organizations navigate an evolving energy landscape, it’s important to consider how the functionality of DERs and microgrids can help maximize the capabilities of energy systems to build the foundation for a stronger, more resilient, and more sustainable future across a company's operations. — Rich Gorze is senior global energy manager for Eaton.

Bian Guangqi, deputy director of the NEA's energy saving and technology equipment department said that by the end of 2024, the total installed capacity of new energy storage projects in China reached 73.76 million kilowatts, which represented an increase of over 130 percent compared to the end of 2023. The average energy storage duration is 2.3 hours, an increase of about 0.2 hours since the end of 2023. New energy storage refers to energy-storage technologies other than conventional pump storage. An energy-storage system charges when wind power or photovoltaic power generates a large volume of electricity or when the power consumption is low, and it discharges otherwise. China's operational efficiency of new energy storage continues to improve. Data from the country's grid companies indicate the sector supports the development and consumption of renewable energy, peak supply assurance, and the stable operation of the power system, thereby, significantly contributing to the construction of a new power system, Bian told a press conference on Thursday. Geographically, the top five provincial-level regions in China for cumulative installed capacity of new energy storage are Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Ningxia. North China represents a highland of the sector with its installed capacity accounting for 30.1 percent of the national total, followed by northwestern regions at 25.4 percent, and eastern regions at 16.9 percent. \"In terms of single-power station installed capacity, new energy storage plants are increasingly exhibiting a trend toward centralization and large-scale operations,\" Bian added. By the end of 2024, projects with an installed capacity of 100,000 kilowatts or above accounted for 62.3 percent of the total, a rise of approximately 10 percentage points from 2023, while projects between 10,000 and 100,000 kilowatts made up 32.8 percent, and those below 10,000 kilowatts stood at 4.9 percent. Regarding storage duration, the share of new energy storage projects with a duration of four hours or more increased to 15.4 percent in 2024, up by about 3 percentage points since the end of 2023. Projects with storage durations between two and four hours represented 71.2 percent, while those with durations of less than two hours accounted for 13.4 percent. \"New energy storage plays an essential regulatory role in the new power system, significantly promoting the development and consumption of renewable energy,\" Bian noted. New energy storage features a high intensity of technology and a long industrial chain, and encompasses multiple sectors. It has nurtured numerous innovative enterprises, facilitated breakthroughs in key technologies, and promoted industrial quality and efficiency, said the official. Moreover, the flexible layout and short construction cycle of new energy storage, along with its wide range of application scenarios, have directly driven investments nearing 200 billion yuan (about $27.89 billion) since the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025), fostering industrial clusters and becoming a new engine for economic development, according to Bian. As China strives to achieve its dual carbon goals, the country is vigorously developing a green economy, with renewable energy as one of the engines, which provides robust demand for the new energy storage industry. Bian said that the NEA would systematically draft the roadmap for the 15th Five-Year Plan with intensified efforts to promote technological innovation in new energy storage. The administration also aims to refine market mechanisms to ensure fair and orderly competition, guiding healthy development of the industry, and enhance international exchanges and cooperation to better support Chinese enterprises \"going global\".

These wind farms are part of the Thrace Wind Power Project, led by China Energy Guohua Investment Europe Renewable Energy SA. Since commencing operations in 2019, the project has generated approximately 160 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, supplying power to more than 30,000 households in Greece. Speaking ahead of the International Day of Clean Energy, the company's deputy general manager, Wu Bate, told Xinhua that the Thrace Wind Power Project was launched following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between China and Greece under the Belt and Road Initiative in 2018. As China's first wind power investment in Greece, the project comprises four wind farms equipped with 34 turbines, with a total installed capacity of 78.2 megawatts. \"The project reduces carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 150,000 tons annually and saves 53,000 tons of standard coal, equivalent to planting 360,000 trees,\" Wu said. \"It has played a pivotal role in supporting Greece's energy transition.\" In recent years, Greece has accelerated its shift toward renewable energy. According to the Greek government's revised National Energy and Climate Plan, renewable energy is projected to account for 75 percent of electricity generation by 2030, increasing further to 95 percent by 2035. Data from the Hellenic Wind Energy Association shows that wind power contributed 23.5 percent of Greece's total electricity generation in 2023. \"The cooperation between Greece and China on renewable energy has been remarkable,\" said Konstantinos Loukidis, the company's development manager. \"Developing renewable energy projects not only optimizes Greece's energy mix and enhances energy independence, but also attracts investment, fosters innovation, creates jobs, and drives economic growth,\" he added. Currently, Chinese companies are actively participating in investment and construction in Greece's renewable energy sector. Wu Bate highlighted the significant potential for further cooperation between China and Greece in the renewable energy sector. \"In the future, both sides will build upon this platform to deepen collaboration in areas such as wind power and photovoltaics, achieving mutual benefits and win-win outcomes while injecting powerful momentum into the global green transition,\" the deputy general manager said.
